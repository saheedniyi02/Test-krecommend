1,"Dennis Naku13 May 2022A Federal High Court sitting in Port Harcourt has granted bail to a governorship aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party in Rivers State, Hon. Farah Dagogo.Justice E. Obile granted Dagogo bail in fundamental rights action and ex parte application sought by his legal team.Justice Obile in his ruling ordered the state Commissioner of Police, Friday Eboka, Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of the State Criminal and Investigation Department, Deputy Superintendent of Police, the state’s Attorney General, and Chief Magistrate, Amadi Nna, to release Dagogo from police detention and restore his personal liberty.The court also issued an order of interim injunction restraining the respondents, especially the police, the commandant of the Government House, DSP Efeturi Irikefe, the fourth respondent, the state Attorney General, and Chief Magistrate A. I. Amadi Nna from further instigating, threatening, harassing and invading the personal liberty of Dagogo.The court equally restrained the respondent from further obstructing the PDP governorship aspirant or hindering him, detaining him in custody from additionally attending his screening in party primaries as well as other electoral processes.The lead lawyer, Dr Innocent Ekwe spoke shortly after the court proceedings, saying the bail application was heard and determined.“The police arrive this evening at the federal high court bringing a letter from the office of the DCR to confirm and verify that the order and warrant admitting him to bail is from the court.“That verification has just been done. Our client is now to be released by the Commissioner of Police.“I filed the proceedings at the federal high court, an application for his bail which was heard and determined. And the terms of the bail have been fulfilled,” he stated.Ekwe pointed out that the PDP knows the consequences of not giving Hon. Dagogo who represents Degema-Bonny federal constituency in the House of Representatives an opportunity to be screened as a governorship aspirant in the state.“And the fact that he was not screened due to the fact that he was abducted from the venue.“We promptly write to the party informing them of the scenario and asking them to give him another fate for him to be screened.“And we know the parry will screen him now that he has been given bail because the party knows the consequences of excluding him unlawfully.“The people who are pursuing prosecution may wish to continue, but we have filed a preliminary objection challenging the information as incompetent and has been politically motivated.https://punchng.com/just-in-court-grants-bail-to-embattled-rivers-pdp-gov-aspirant-dagogo/","Court Grants Bail To Embattled Rivers PDP Governor Aspirant, Hon.

Many of the beneficiaries were workers at the Khadimiyya for Justice and Development Initiative, a foundation he established.This had triggered backlash as some said it was a move to get Malami soft landing ahead of the APC governorship primaries.But on Friday night, Daily Trust gathered that the minster, who was among those President Muhammadu Buhari bade farewell at Aso Rock earlier in the day, had opted out of the race.Sources close to the minister told Daily Trust that Malami had withdrawn from the race.When contacted, Umar Gwandu, his media aide, simply said, “I have not been officially briefed.”Buhari had ordered his appointees with interest in the 2023 election to step down.https://dailytrust.com/breaking-malami-pulls-out-of-kebbi-governorship-race",Malami Pulls Out Of Kebbi Governorship Race
7,"Open Letter To Tuface Idibia- From National Youth Force  2023Sir,FROM THE STREETS TO THE POLLSWe write to you under the Auspices of the NATIONAL YOUTH FORCE which is a representation of the many Nigerian Youths who cry out daily for a stake in credible Governance. It is no longer news that the Government of the day has failed us and indeed have been a recycling of multitude of incompetent hands running the affairs of a country so blessed in its diversity. It is regrettable to note that in spite of a huge human capital and enormous natural resources, unemployment, poverty and insecurity continue to plague us. These current crop of people in Government have consistently divided us against ethnic and religious lines and have at various stages and times consistently refused to address the many National and indeed institutional challenges bedeviling us as a nation. They’d rather milk human tragedy for political profit to the detriment of the citizenry. At this critical time in our electoral landscape, we are faced between terrible choices. Either returning elected, those who are responsible for our sufferings, loss of lives, Police brutality, Banditary, Terrorism, delayed justice, Accidents due to poor infrastructures, air mishap, poor health facilities, Poor education system, poverty and unemployment ravaging our teeming youths population all over the country or bringing back the same individuals that caused us the need to vote in this regrettable change. We do not think that as Nigerians and as youths who control the largest number of voters and influence in our electoral landscape should be made to choose between disaster and catastrophe. We propose a third force which we have herein above stated as the National Youth force. In the National youth force, we propose an over 50 percent of youths in Governance to bring their various global and local experiences to bear in running a Government that is in tandem with modern day political realities. This we can only achieve with a Nigerian president of the youth constituency. Sir, under the leadership of the National youth force, ethnic and religious inclinations would never hinder productivity and progress of this nation. This is reflected when the teeming youths devoid of age, tribe, religion, and in the spirit of our founding fathers and our constitution, defied all odds and came together and protested against the bad Governance prevalent in this country.We need to rally round 'A Youth' to represent us as President of a new Nigeria. It is not new to us that Nigerians continue to see the visions of the old men's leadership called Nigeria of today when it is the young men who should see and take charge of a future they should be part of. We believe that we have come of age to participate in running the affairs of this nation. The National Youth Force has become the strength of our new nation and should neither be neglected nor taken for granted in the affairs of this country, where we can collectively control our future in the face of modern day civilization, digitalization and technological activities.We can't do this without you and other well meaning Nigerians of the youth and digital constituency staking your influence and personality as a true patriot who has always long for a better Nigeria as has been reflected in your music like “for instance” “E be like say” etc. these songs at the time inspired us to rise up in our consciousness to demand for a better Nigeria or otherwise a New Nigeria. Nigerian Youths irrespective of tribe, The Igbos, Hausas, Yorubas, and others need your voice at this moment to invigorate the third force otherwise called the youth force. This is what we should do to create a New Nigeria for us and for our generation yet unborn.On behalf of the Nigerian Youths, we thank you as you give this request a favorable and inspiring response.Best regardsNational Youth Force Convener.Dr Emeka Mandela.https://www.facebook.com/107004405329193/posts/117834184246215/",Open Letter To Tuface Idibia -From National Youth Force  2023

The thought of being separated from them for any reason is unbearable to us, so we have decided that we will reject any attempt by anyone to use Nairaland to promote the idea of removing Igbos and Niger Deltans from Nigeria.We have updated rule 9 of Nairaland to reflect this decision. It now says:9. Don't use Nairaland for illegal acts, e.g scams, plagiarism, hacking, gay meetings, incitement, promoting secession.I'd like to urge all Nairaland members to respect and obey rule 9.

9,"Dear SOUTHEAST PDP delegates,Ever since Peter Obi, a PDP leading presidential aspirant started his tour, the spirit of one Nigeria became resurrected. Obi who is from Anambra state, which is in the very zone Nigerians are clamouring to produce the next president has been touring the country telling Nigerians what he will do if elected–an issue-based campaign.I don't know what is happening or what happened, but, his campaign seems to have dwarfed that of the other aspirants.I had said earlier that PDP by throwing its presidential ticket open is not being fair to the SE. But let's say they want to deceive the APC as the broom party has been waiting to know where the umbrella party will zone their presidential ticket...Nonetheless, the PDP Southeast delegates have to deliver Peter Obi. I am not arrogant about it, so I shall explain why:1. We will not prove to those who say that SE can never come together to achieve one political goal that they have been right all along.2. PDP believes that even if they don't pick a candidate from the Igbo extraction, they have nothing to lose.3. By giving Obi a bloc vote we will be making a strong political statement.4. ""The boy calls you father, do not have a hand in his death""The villagers knew that Ikemefuna would die. The thing is, Okonkwo should not have had a hand in his death.Ikemefuna was young and could have outrun the elderly men. Instead, he turned toward Okonkwo whom he trusted would not hurt him. But, Okonkwo, to show that he was still Okonkwo the great killed the boy that calls him father, whom he loved dearly in return. His life never remained the same. There are some lines one should not cross. Even if people will call you weak or stupid.Don't show us that you are a typical Nigerian politician, show us that you can protect our collective interest as a people. Even if delegates from other zones chose to vote against Peter Obi, do not be part of it. Please deliver Okwute. Do your part and let the universe take it from there.Nigerians across the country–ethnicity, religion and even political parties, said it is the turn of the Igbos from the SE to produce the next president, the name Peter Obi has been ringing loudly across the nation. If you deliver Peter, he will win the main election. Whatever happens, let it not be said or heard that the Southeast delegates did not vote for nwanne ha. It will be a thing of shame and ridicule and will affect your own political career. Izu kakwa mma na nneji.5. Most importantly, Mr Peter Gregory Obi, is competent.By Nnenna Oparaocha@mynd44 OAM4J","Peter Obi Stand A Good Chance If SE, PDP Give Him Their Bloc Votes."
10,"2023 Presidency: Christians won’t vote Muslim-Muslim presidential candidates — PFN*It would be wrong for President Buhari not to hand over to a Christian after 8 years.*The killers of Deborah deserve the punishment for killers.By Timothy Agbor, OsogboThe National President of Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), Bishop Francis Wale Oke, yesterday, declared that Christians will not support any political party that fields Muslim-Muslim ticket in the 2023 polls.Bishop Oke made this known in Osogbo, Osun State, during the celebration of 30th anniversary of PFN in the state.Oke, in a statement, by the state Director of Media, Bishop Seun Adeoye explained that Nigeria is a secular state and that Christians will not fold their arms to allow a situation where the president and the vice-president would be Muslims.According to him, it would also be wrong for a Muslim to take over from President Muhammadu Buhari after eight years as president.“The Church in Nigeria is saying no to a Muslim-Muslim ticket. We are going to mobilise the church against such political party. PFN has 65 million people and we will vote against such party.”He said: “Obasanjo handed over to Yar’adua, Yar’adua to Jonathan and Jonathan to Buhari and who else should Buhari hand over to if not a Christian?”Oke called on all PFN members to ensure they possess their Permanent Voter Cards (PVC) and should vote out any bad government.On the killing of Deborah Samuel in Sokoto, the PFN President condemned those who killed in the name of religion, adding that killing in the name of religion is barbaric, unrighteous, ungodly and demonic. “We want killings in the name of religion to stop in Nigeria.“It is regrettable that one of our daughters was stoned to death and set ablaze. We urge all religion leaders in Nigeria to educate their adherents. Nigeria is not again in Stone Age. It is a criminal offence and the killers should be fished out and brought to book.”They are killers and the punishment meant for killers be meted on them,” he said.In his speech, the Governor of Osun State, Alhaji Adegboyega Oyetola, represented by his deputy, Mr. Gboyega Alabi, explained that the roles being played by his government in ensuring peace in the state.The National Vice-President (South-West), Archbishop John Alagbala Osa-Oni and the state Chairman of PFN, Prophet Isaiah Adelowokan, noted that the PFN in the zone and the state are fully committed to the PFN 10 point agenda.Source: The Punch",2023 Presidency: Christians Won’t Vote Muslim-muslim Presidential Candidates-pfn
11,"Members of the All Progressives Congress in Kaduna State have begged former the national leader of the party and presidential aspirant, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, to pick Kano State Governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, as his running mate in the 2023 presidential race.Tinubu had last Thursday visited Kaduna to canvass for the votes of the 69 Kaduna APC delegates ahead of the party’s presidential primary.The presidential hopeful had told the delegates that he was confident that he would be the nation’s next President when the incumbent President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), bows out next year.Tinubu had said, “Some are running, I don’t know to where they are going but I am going to the Villa.”Against this background, the Kaduna PDP delegates unanimously endorsed Tinubu, while the Kaduna chapter of the APC pleaded with Tinubu to pick El-Rufai as his running mate.Speaking on behalf of the Kaduna delegates, the lawmaker representing Sabon Gari, Kaduna Federal Constituency and Chairman, House Committee on Ports and Harbours,  Garba  Babawo, appealed to Tinubu to pick El-rufai as his running mate.Babawo said, “We have a request for you (Tinubu), sir. What I’m about to say I did not tell our governor because I know if I tell him he would not support it. We want you to take our governor as your running mate. “We don’t want him to go and settle outside the country after the election because we know his plan. His plan is to leave the country and live in overseas after his tenure as the governor. But we want him to serve the country as your running mate”.Meanwhile, unconfirmed reports said Tinubu gifted the delegates with N60m.Earlier, in his remarks at the event, a former governor of Borno State, Senator Kashim Shettima, had said that Tinubu had the leadership attributes of all the past leaders of the country, particularly the humility and peace-loving nature of General Yakubu Gowon.Shettima added that Tinubu also had some attributes of General Ibrahim Babangida and the late General Sani Abacha in Tinubu.https://punchng.com/el-rufai-plans-to-live-abroad-after-tenure-kaduna-reps/","Kaduna PDP Delegates Endorse Tinubu, APC Delegates Ask For El-Rufai As VP"
12,"THE Nigerian Bar Association’s dis-inviting of Nasir El-Rufai from debasing its platform at its last conference due to the pressure of open bar initiative that a man who has outright disregard for the rule of law is not a good teacher for lawyers on the subject is a good example of constructing amoral finishing post for a society. A major reason for the festering of impunity in our non-country is the collapse of all moral columns that make people commit all crimes and go on to become Very Important Personalities (VIPS).One of such VIPs, who has an unresolved murder allegation hanging on his neck, is Sanusi Lamido Sanusi who was removed as the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria and dethroned as the Emir of Kano.Since he escaped paying for the crime of alleged murder in 1995, he has occupied many important posts in the country and he mounts every platform to talk down on the country and abuse all those he can pick on at his garrulous best. He was at it again on the 60th Independence anniversary of Nigeria when he mounted the platform of the Convenant Christian Centre.This time round, he lambasted identity groups in the country who he accused of representing only themselves and their families. His prescription for the country was that every citizen has to be worthy representative of their beliefs, religions and groups. But if this were a country that makes all citizens account for their actions, no matter their status, beliefs and regions, where will Sanusi have been today?In 1995, a group of nine Wahabists were alleged to have committed murder in Kano. A report in 2012 by Pointblanknews alleged that Gideon Akaluka, a young Igbo trader, allegedly desecrated the Koran. He was arrested after his wife allegedly used pages of the Koran as toilet paper for her baby. “After he was locked up by the police, a group of Muslim fundamentalists broke into the jail, beheaded Akaluka, and paraded his bodiless head around the streets of Kano.”The medium went on to make some earth-shaking revelations. “Pointblanknews.com investigation revealed the alleged role Sanusi, an alleged Boko Haram sympathiser, and proponent of the controversial Islamic Bank, played in the murder of Akaluka, and why the Abacha regime decided to lock him up for two years for the murder of Akaluka. “Sources hinted that shortly after returning from Khartoum, Sudan where he earned a degree in Sharia and Islamic studies, at the International University of Africa, Sanusi became a recluse and immersed himself in the Koran and became a teacher of the Hadith as espoused by the Wahabbists.”“Wahhabism is an ultra-conservative branch of Sunni Islam. It is a religious movement among fundamentalist (with an aspiration to return to the primordial fundamental Islamic sources: Qu’ran, Hadeeth and Scholarly consensus (Ijma)) of Islamic believers. Wahhabism was a popular revivalist movement instigated by an 18th century theologian, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab (1703-1792). A source said, “when Sanusi returned from Sudan where he associated with very extreme personalities, he was not a happy man. He was treated like an outcast in royal circles because his grandfather was eposed as Emir of Kano. So his anger grew. “During that period, the incident of desecration of the Koran by the Akalukas surfaced.“ According to our source, during that period the Abacha government was not comfortable with the activities of the extremists in Kano, who they view with suspicion. The regime, it was gathered, silently assassinated a lot of them,” said our source. “When Akaluka was locked up, Sanusi and eight others allegedly mobilised some extremist mob who stormed the prison and killed Akaluka. The regime identified the masterminds and so mandated its hit squad to eliminate the nine, including Sanusi.Pointblanknews.com gathered that eight of the masterminds were assassinated by Abacha, but for the intervention of former First Bank chairman, and father of Christmas Day bomber, Alhaji Umar Mutallab and others. It was Muttallab and the rest who were heavy sponsors of Islamic activities who prevailed on Abacha to spare Sanusi. They are argued that since he has gone through a lot, treated like a pariah in the royal circles because his grandfather was deposed, he should be spared. So, they decided to remove him from Kano to Sokoto where he was locked up for two years,” said the source.It was further learnt that after his release from prison, Sanusi was handed over to Mutallab who pushed him into banking because he (Sanusi) had a degree in Economics from the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU). From there, he moved to the United Bank for Africa, and the First Bank, from where he rose quietly until the late President Umaru Yar’Adua recruited him to head CBN and spearhead the introduction of the Islamic Bank.” A report by Karl Maier for the Independent of London on August 16, 1995 with the title “Beheading Stirs Nigerian tension” had this worrying perspective from religious leaders: “Anger over Nigeria’s economic collapse, the result of instability, rampant corruption and mismanagement by 12 years of military rule, runs deep in Kano. “Whenever you find people not properly employed, there is no other way to express yourself, because you have the police, and the emirs and their agents looking for troublemakers,” said Professor Mahadi. “So the most important thing is to express this in Islam.”Observers from both sides of the ethnic and religious divide blame Nigeria’s military authorities for worsening the crisis. “The military have always played this card very well,” said Fr Bagobiri. “Because the whole thing started during the [Ibrahim] Babangida regime. That was when the religious divide became very strong.”The government’s disastrous handling of the Akaluka affair is a case in point. Mr (Maitama) Sule, normally a defender of General Sani Abacha’s military regime, describing it as “experienced and responsible”, was outraged by the incident. “I can’t understand how in a society where we have a government, the police and judiciary, that a group of people take the law into their own hands, go to the prison, break into the prison, and get somebody out of his cell, cut off his head, and take the head around the next day with impunity.”Observers like Father Kukah see the sinister hand of the military and the Northern elite behind the trouble. “Let’s be clear: there are Nigerians who have invested heavily in violence, in ignorance, in poverty, in turbulence. Because it is when you now have this anarchic situation, that they present themselves as the praetorian guard.”Sanusi has not been able to explain away his alleged role in the Akaluka affair. He threatened to sue one man who was haunting him-with the issue over 10 years ago, but the suit has yet to come. Neither has there been any explanation for the two years that his whereabouts cannot be explained in his CV. The Akaluka case is dead and no justice done outside the Wahabists Abacha allegedly executed extra-judicially.Nigeria has the blood of many Akalukas on its hands with their killers walking free. Its woes will continue until it dispenses justice.

Na church bring their computer make I repair, na hin I see one recording where dis tin deyThose of you who are getting ready to vote for Asiwaju are just wasting your time. His aspiration has already been flagged down by some interested parties.Their form of attack is what is known in military terms as a pincer movement . He has been surrounded and the bear hug is tightening around him everyday. Let me explain. The pincer movement, is a tactic in which forces attack both sides of an enemy formation at the same time. The idea is to encircle the enemy and totally decimate him. But sometimes the idea is to leave the enemy an escape route* First these parties made sure that the north saw Tinubu not as an ally of Buhari. But rather as an opponent, weak link and untrustworthy associate. The comment by the president, about Tinubu being in Lagos and trying to call the shots comes to mind"" They orchestrated the emergence of Saraki as the NASS president and put the Asiwaju and Saraki in a feud. This was a stone that killed two birds. First to put the NPDP against the ACN. And also, to weaken the Asiwaju's influence in the APC government* They created the Not too young to run bill to give the North, and the nation in general the direction to go in a post-Buhari era. They made sure that the nation developed an appetite for young leaders* They harped and took advantage of the incessant clashes between the herdsmen and farmers in the southwest. They took advantage of the Asiwaju's silence on the impact of these skirmishes on the southwest. This was directed not at the fanatic Awoist southwestern individual. But rather at the indifferent southwestern individual who could be found on the fringes of the PDP* They orchestrated and manipulated the feud between oshiomole and the Edo state Governor, obaseki. Through cleverly planted local media stories, they were able to paint the Asiwaju as an occupier and invading force. As a result, the Asiwaju lost his only support base in the South-South. * They used the outcome of the Edo state election and the loss of the state to instigate a palace Coup that ousted oshiomole from the position of party chairman. With this they cut off the Asiwaju from the APC power machinery. . * They manipulated the outcome of the kwara state election that saw the fall of the house of saraki, as a media campaign against the Asiwaju. They painted him as an outsider and occupier to the kwara people. Forget what was reported in the media, the Asiwaju is now hated by the people of kwara* They fashioned the EndSars protests as a question on the Asiwaju's indifference to the plight of youths and people in the southwest * Last and definitely not the only ones, they let the Asiwaju be himself. All of their attacks were two pronged. The first attack was always to push the Asiwaju to act in a manner they had already anticipated. And the second was to take advantage of his action and use it against himThese are the only ones I have been able to notice. They are probably more. In summary , the Asiwaju has been cut off from the Southeast and the Southsouth. His image has been damaged and ridiculed in the north. His influence in the Southwest has been whittled and he has been isolated in the center. He has been cut off from his power blocs, and his reinforcements. His supply lines have been thinned out and he is completely expended . In essence, a once regional demigod has been transformed into a centrist pencil pusher.  I don't know which politician will eventually emerge as the president of the federal republic of Nigeria. But I do know that a vote for the Asiwaju is a vote wasted.

24,"The Untold Story of Osisikankwu, The Most Notorious And Dreaded Kidnap Kingpin in Ngwaland, Abia state. There are kidnappers and there are kidnappers but the story of Obiọma Nwankwo, popularly known as Osisikankwu will always remain indelible in the history of kidnapping in Nigeria. His was a story of an obdurate fellow who recruited more than 3000 men into the nefarious job of kidnapping that terrorised the whole of Abia State especially Aba and environs, even down to Obigbo in Rivers State. If you had lived in Aba circa 2007- 2010, you would understand definitely what I am saying. It got so terrible that at a point that the whole of Aba was sacked as the kidnappings got intensified. People packed their belongings and relocated to their villages, many big cats in Aba and environs left Ngwaland, Abia State government's officials were not spared. Hundreds were abducted, tortured, killed and made to cough out millions to free themselves from the shackles of captivity. Aba and surrounding Ngwa villages almost became a ghost area as people left in their thousands to escape being the next bird of sacrifice. In my area then at the periphery of Aba, just near the then new timber market at Uratta, the wives of two fat cows in the area were kidnapped. They were later released after their husbands had paid the agreed ransome. They equally came for the MD of Calif Hospital in my area but the renowned surgeon escaped and  fled Aba. It was not a nice experience. There were also ugly stories of rape and murder. My mother and four sisters had to relocate to the village for the time being to avoid being ravaged by those monsters. There were numerous gun battles in broad daylight. Many people lost their lives. Osisikankwu is from Ogwe area of Ukwa West LGA of Abia State. He succeeded in organising a formidable kidnap gang of about 3000 mean men solely for abduction and killing. They mainly target the affluent class, expatriates and highly placed government officials of Abia State. The Government of Abia State then under the leadership of Dr Theodore Ahamefula Orji was handicapped. Nothing could be done as hordes of Aba residents were either killed by the rampaging Aba kidnap gang. 1. Three British Nationals and a Columbian contract staff of NetcoDietmann working at Shell's Power Plant in Afam VI, Oyigbo LGA of Rivers State were kidnapped by gunmen on January, 12. They barricaded their vehicle on their way back to Oyigbo at Owaza junction in Ukwa West LGA of Abia State. They were whisked away after shooting to death a mobile police officer escorting them. The white men were identified as John Bennet, Kelvin Gray and Martin Phillip, all Britons with Fabian Sanchez as the only Columbian. NetcoDietmann and Rivers State government paid a huge ransome before they were freed. 2. In April and May of 2010, two German and three Chnese nationals together with Nine Nigerians working for Nigerian Steel Company, Aba, were kidnapped by Osisikankwu's gang. They were later released after the payment of millions of naira. 3. On July 10, one Mrs Victoria Ori, the wife of an rich bull from Ohafia was abducted by a 4-member gang who demanded for a whooping sum of ₦20 million naira. Mrs Ori was released after a reasonable amount was paid.Just a day after the kidnap of Mrs Ori, three Journalists, together with their driver, travelling through Aba after a meeting of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State were whisked away at Umuafuoka junction near Ukpakiri, Obingwa LGA of Abia State by Osisikankwu's men. The kidnapped Journalists include: Wahab Oba, Lagos State Chairman of NUJ, Adolphus Okonkwo, secretary of Zone G of the NUJ, Slyvester Okereke, acting secretary, Lagos, NUJ, Sola Oyeyipo, a Lagos-based journalist and their driver. A reliable source disclosed to Saharareporters that ₦30 million was paid before the men were released from the kidnapper's lair. 5. On Tuesday, August 24, Osisikankwu's gang led by a young thug called 'Okwute' STONE robbed  five commercial banks in the Osisioma area of Aba, Killing all policemen and security on guard. The affected banks were closed down till date. 6. On Sunday, September 7, masked gunmen numbering about 15 stormed the 5000 capacity of Jerusalem for All Nations Church at Umuneke Community and bundled away the church's senior pastor, fondly called Christ Junior by his sheeples. A politician, identified as Lambert Nmecha was killed during the operation. 7. On Saturday, September 11, an Indian national working with an electronic company in Aba was killed by a  five-man kidnap thugs after he intransigently refused to follow the men in their car. The thugs  fled the scene afterwards. 8. A gynaecologist and proprietor of Victory Christian Hospital at Obohia Road, Aba, Dr Stanley Uche was picked up by those monsters on September 17 as he travelled down to Imo State for a family burial with his wife. The wife was later released to go and organise a ₦30 million ransom. She later brought the money only to be given the lidless body of her husband. Aba women's cries rose to high heavens. I believe God heard their wailings and ululation. Dr Uche's hospital was one of the best for child delivery in Aba but he was unfortunately killed by Osisikankwu's men. 9. On Saturday, September 25, two mobile policemen on patrol in their new Hilux were killed in an ambush at Umuafor Ukwu, Obingwa lga of Abia State. After that incident, Abia State Police Command lamented that it has lost 27 of its members to Osisikankwu's gang. As if that was not enough, Osisikankwu and his men struck again on Monday, 27th September at Abayi International School, Osisioma, Aba, kidnapping 15 pupils of the school. This was the height of it all, the zenith of all their atrocities. The kidnappers, patrolling in an ash-coloured Toyota Camry intercepted Abayi International school's van and diverted it to an unknown destination. The school children were later released unscathed but the story has gone viral, even capturing the attention of International media houses who expressed disgust at the kidnap crisis engulfing Aba. Consequently, he was declared wanted by the Nigeria Army and police. In what appeared to be an inadvertent confessional statement recorded by Chidi Nkwopara, of Vanguard Newspapers, the correspondent was tricked into granting an unsolicited interview by Osisikankwu himself. Mr Nkwopara was deluded into coming to Aba to collect money for advert placement on Vanguard. According to Mr Nkwopara, he declined on grounds that Aba was a no-go area but the caller persuaded him to come to a popular place at Osisioma to belie his fears. Mr Nkwopara however, agreed and came down to Aba only to meet the dreaded and most wanted militant leader and kidnapper, Osisikankwu. Since he had been declared wanted, Osisikankwu wanted to use the medium to ventilate himself on why he decided to pick up arms and resort to theft and kidnap.In the interview which lasted for 30 minutes, Osisikankwu admitted to be the mastermind behind the kerfuffle engulfing Abia State as a whole. He said he was on mission to liberate Ngwaland, the largest tribe in Abia State. According to him, Ngwaland has been marginalised despite harbouring the commercial and industrial city of Aba and being the oil producing enclave of Abia State. Since the creation of Abia State, other smaller tribes in the state such as the Igberre, Abriba, Ohafia, Umuahia, Item, Aro etc, have being advantaged. Only Ukwa-Ngwa, the largest tribe in the state with nine local governments were neglected, relegated to the background. He complained about the grim and ramshackle roads in Aba, the corruption of the T. A Orji kedu Government and the ballooning cases of unemployment among Ukwa-Ngwa youths. He was happy the world then knew about their activities and was willing to surrender and be granted amnesty and rehabilitation only if the Abia State government was willing to help them. The Igbo people will invariably say that one does not stay in his home and grow hunchback or squash his scrotum. Also, an elder will not sit down silent while the goat suffers the pains of parturition while tethered to a stake. Home is where comfort lies and when an enemy comes to disrupt the peace of a home, such enemy must be chased away. Following the abduction of Aba School Children which raised dust globally, the Federal Government under the leadership of newly sworn-in Goodluck Ebele Jonathan had to intervene. A troop of Joint Military Task Force was deployed to Abia State on a mission to crack down on the kidnappers. The Military Task Force worked hard until December 12, when they successfully caught and killed the small shit that ruins the anus: OSISIKANKWU! According to Lt. Col. Sagir Musa, an Army Spokesman then, the notorious criminal was killed at Ugwuati Evil Forest in Ukwa West LGA of Abia State, after a  fierce gun duel between the Joint Military Task Force and Osisikankwu's gang. It was a war of charms, of juju and of the paranormal. The soldiers after emerging victorious displayed the body of the kidnap kingpin in an open van round Aba to the ecstasy and jubilation of Aba residents. How Art the mighty fallen. Osisikankwu's girlfriend, Ogochi was also arrested during the operation. Ogochi who was reportedly three months pregnant pointed out the exact locations where Osisikankwu's lair was. Consequent upon the revelation, a mop of operation was carried out the JTF in the Ugwuati Evil Forest. The operation led to the recovery of the following: 48 empty magazine of AK 47; 3,848 rounds of 7.62mm special ammunition; 538 rounds of 7.62 mm Nato; 41 expended cases of 7.62mm special ammunition; some quantity of dynamite and 3 RPG prima. In a swift reaction, the Abia State Government, under the Theodore Orji kedu administration, described the killing of Osisikankwu as the 'triumph of light over darkness' and commended the JTF for their dogged  fight against the notorious",Biafra: Why I Fought For Ngwaland Liberation- Osisikanwu
25,"_”If you have achieved any level of success, then pour it into someone else. Success is not success without a successor” – TD JakesOn December 2, 2018, President Muhammadu Buhari made a profound statement during a meeting with Nigerians in Poland. It was the height of conspiracy about whether or not he was cloned and Nigerians in Diaspora felt the need to clear the air on the matter, so they asked him.Here’s how he responded: “A lot of people hoped that I was dead. Poor Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, even he had to deal with the rumours—Some people reached out to him to consider them to be his Vice President because they assumed I was dead. That embarrassed him a lot; we discussed it when he visited me while I was convalescing. I can assure you all that this is the real me. Later this month I will celebrate my 76th birthday. And I’m still going strong,” he said.Buhari’s response reverberated from Poland to Nigeria and indeed across the world. Loyalty had reached a new height and Prof. Osinbajo is the architect. Not many knew how loyal the deputy was to his master and how much he protected his interest. Those who had approached the then Acting President to become his Vice President were thoroughly ashamed of themselves.And this is one of many reasons  Nigerians are wondering why President Muhammadu Buhari has not endorsed his loyal, hardworking, competent and patriotic deputy, but again, the style and strategy of the President is very different.Just as we have presidential candidates awash the APC today, we had so many twists and turns leading to the national convention. Many names were thrown up as the favourite and the acting committee was throwing all sorts of fireworks into the ring including court cases but the President knew his choice and he waited until it was the right time.In his Channels TV interview, Buhari refrained from naming who his successor was, his response was quite cryptic. He said: “No, I wouldn’t say because he may be eliminated if I mention. I better keep it,” the President said with a wry smile.For many Nigerians it’s a no-brainer that President Buhari picks his successor, in fact, that is a hallmark of successful leaders but in doing so, the President must have to consider a few things which are dear to many Nigerians but more importantly Nigerians need someone with capacity to execute.Many will agree with me that President Buhari is keeping the name of his successor close to his chest but one thing that he must consider most is that Nigerians need a patriot. Someone who is not thinking about enriching himself, family, friends and associates but someone who is dedicated to enriching all Nigerians as much as he can.Those closest to the President will be trying to sway him, they will be putting up names that best suit them and a few others. They will be putting up names of those who can help them to continue to hold Nigeria to ransom but what Nigerians want is leader that will be father to all.A leader that can speak the global language and who has already earned global respect. A leader who is keeping up with the times and who understands the importance of technology, human capital development and leadership.A detribalized leader who will put Nigeria first and will always act on behalf of Nigeria and Nigerians on all local and international issues. Whosoever President Buhari picks as his successor will be ultimate legacy and I think he will want to leave a lasting legacy.For those lurking around the President and who have decided to throw all sorts of people up, to extent that they are buying Expression of Interest and Nomination forms under all sorts of groups, I hope the President is not deceived or confused by their antics.Just like Buhari, Nigeria deserves a very popular candidate amongst the citizen. One that can go to the South South and the reception will be wild. A candidate that can visit the North East and the people will be chasing after his bus; a candidate that will go to the North Central and shake hands with the citizens; a candidate that will dress in.https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/05/why-osinbajo-may-be-president-buharis-choice/amp/&ved=2ahUKEwivl96K8t73AhUugf0HHerqDuUQFnoECBAQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3uCDPBy_aeSOFU4zvlIE5x",Why Osinbajo May Be President Buhari’s Choice

27,"Are you aware that sometime in 1939 some Anioma communities in present day Delta and Edo states was carved out of the core Igbo heartland despite protests from Anioma kings then to the British colonial authorities?The same period the Ezza community of present Ebonyi state was carved into Benue state of present day.Again, in 1976 during the Murtala Mohammed regime, Ahoada and Port Harcourt was ceded to Ijaw dominated River state. Do you still wonder how Igbo speaking people are now minorities in other states?This was carried out despite rejection by the people to the Willink commission on boundary adjustment.Still in 1976, oil rich Obigbo LGA in Aba division of old Imo state was ceded to Rivers state. Obigbo is Ndoki clan and has over 50 oil wells, they are pure Igbo people separated from their Azummili kins by the Imo river.Ohugbu, an oil rich Ndoki community was ceded to Akwa Ibom state. Ohugbu is one of the highest onshore gas and oil producing area.In the same 1976, the Egbema community was balkanized into three towns with the highest oil producing town ceded to River state from old Imo state.Same time too, Ndoni was carved out of Aboha and given to Rivers state. Ndoni and Ogbaru are same people. Ogbaru is in Anambra with some of their kinsmen in Delta state.We know that these oil producing areas of Igbo land was the highest oil producing areas pre 1966 and that the Hausa/Fulani led military government has partitioned our land in other to remove Igbo land as the highest oil producing region in the land.The envious Hausa/Fulani government acted contemptuously in other to gain control of our oil and soon after these sordid act, they started sharing our oil wells to themselves hence, today they control almost eighty two of such.This is where I expect Ohaneze to act.

Barr. Festus opined, political misinformation is the grandmother of disorder and fake news especially with the use of social media adding that misinformation in present day society has led to specter of political violence where politicians and supporters misconstrue facts for selfish interest.He sued media practitioners to be knowledgeable enough to know everything; not only identifying misinformation but also to authenticate information that comes to it especially pertaining to INEC and elections. He charged the citizens to go get registered and obtain their Permanent Voters Cards, vote and protect their votes as elections are not held on social media.Meanwhile, the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) has warned broadcast stations of unethical conducts.The State Coordinator of NBC, Mr. Peter Omamogho, while speaking, said as political activities in the country muscles up, it is important for broadcast stations to adhere strictly to the commission’s code of conduct.Peter disclosed that the broadcasting body is geared to sanitize the air wave in this political festivity and any station which defaults to its rules and regulations will have no option than to “help the commission pay fines” that will follow.Giving a pep talk at the event, the national president, National Youth Council of Nigeria, Solomon Adodo called on youths never allow themselves to be used for political thuggery, ferment violence among other vices by politicians.Speaking with journalists shortly after the event, the General Manager of Sparkling Frequency Modulation (FM), Mr. Joshua Moses thanked God for the success of the event.Moses said attaining four years of broadcasting is laudable and looks forward to great improvements.

42,"AFRICAN, CARIBBEAN, PACIFIC STATES SHOULD ENGAGE MORE ON CLIMATE CHANGE, PEACE & SECURITY, DEBT CANCELLATION, SAYS OSINBAJO *VP receives Secretary General of Organization of African, Caribbean, Pacific States at Presidential Villa  African, Caribbean and Pacific States should engage more among themselves and collectively review and address issues affecting them especially issues relating to peace, security, climate change and debt relief, according to Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, SAN. Prof. Osinbajo stated this today when received the Secretary General of the Organization of African, Caribbean and Pacific States (OACPS), Mr Georges Rebelo Pinto Chikoti, on a courtesy visit to the Presidential Villa. “I am pleased that you are taking the path of proactively engaging with member states. I think this is really crucial because as with any of the multilateral organizations, we need to not only be constantly engaged with member states, we also need to understand what it is that is going on.  “This fits into your strategic objective which is to engage and to modernize the organization and to look for alternative means of financing and be more efficient, it is very commendable and I am very pleased to see that it is a step you are taking,"" the VP said  Commending the organization for its efforts and commitment to restructure for better service delivery, the VP noted that “member states are happier when resources are directed at programmes that benefit them directly.  According to him “just looking at the thematic area that the organization has outlined, some require much attention, the theme on peace and security, climate change and environmental sustainability.”  Specifically on the issue of Climate Change, the Vice President urged developing countries to be more forceful on its position, stating that “we may be shortchanging ourselves by making commitments to carbon neutrality within the time specified by wealthier countries and not taking into account our challenges and peculiarities.”  Prof. Osinbajo then urged the OACP, being an organization that is concerned with South-South collaboration, to “champion some of the important themes on climate change and especially the perspective of the developing countries.”  The VP added that though the issue of debt cancellation for developing countries is gaining traction, “it is crucial for African states to be bold and forceful in its advocacy. “I think that one of the major initiatives that the global South has to really promote now is how to be able to take care of its health needs (of course with as much support that we can get from the wealthier countries).”  Earlier in his remarks, Mr Georges Rebelo Pinto Chikoti said the visit to Nigeria was part of his tour of member states of the OACPS to speak about ongoing reforms and restructuring in the organization.  He said the OACPS is now making efforts to secure new alliances and strengthen strategic partnerships especially with the European Union and others to achieve set objectives.  The OACPS Secretary General said the organization has constituted an inter-regional coordination committee, a business forum, cultural foundation, a parliamentary assembly, among others, to ensure efficiency in the running of the body.  He acknowledged Nigeria’s contributions to member states through technical cooperation over the years, and commended the leadership of President Buhari and the Vice President in actualization of goals of the country’s Technical Aid Corps programme.  The Secretary General was accompanied on the visit by the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Amb. Zubairu Dada; Nigeria’s Ambassador to Belgium, Amb.

44,"Don’t Insult Prophets Of Other Religions; Violence, Terrorism Are Mere Symptoms, Provocation Is The Real Disease – Islamic Group, MURIC, Tells NigeriansThe Director of The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), Professor Ishaq Akintola has criticised the killing of a student, Deborah Samuel, over alleged blasphemy in Sokoto on Thursday.This was circulated in a statement released on Friday, May 13, 2022. Through the statement, the MURIC leader regarded the murder as horrible and without legal justification.The statement reads: ""A female student of the Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto, Deborah Samuel, was on Thursday killed for allegedly blaspheming against the Prophet Muhammad (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The blaspheme statement was reportedly posted on a WhatsApp group.“She was asked to withdraw the statement but she allegedly refused to do so. The school’s security unit and police were overwhelmed by the crowd when they tried to rescue her.“MURIC strongly condemns this killing and all others that have been happening in Nigeria in recent times. Those aggrieved by the student’s post should have reported her to the security agencies or the Shariah police, the hisbah. Mob killing is archaic and bohemian. It belongs to the Stone Age. Nobody has the right to take the law into his hands. “The Glorious Qur’an compares the killing of a single person to the killing of the whole of humanity just as it compares the saving of life to the rescue of all homo sapiens (Qur’an 5:32) In like manner, Prophet Muhammad (SAW) himself condemned all acts of violence and advocated peaceful conduct at all times. “But this incident should not be condemned in isolation. The recent trend whereby Nigerians now freely shed their brothers' blood should be condemned by all patriots. In this regard, we also strongly denounce the killing of several Northern Muslims in the South East in the past few months.“We frown on the recent burning last week of a truck fully loaded with cows in the South East as well as the killing of many Muslims of South-East origin by their Igbo brothers in the same South East. We note with keen interest that Muslims in the North did not retaliate when these killings were taking place.“MURIC calls on the Sokoto Police Command to do everything within its power to get to the bottom of yesterday's killing of the female student over alleged blasphemy. We appeal to members of the public to remain calm and law-abiding. Nigerians should allow the police to carry out their investigations on the case. The Sokoto Police Command has started well as it already has two suspects in detention for the killing.“Meanwhile we remind Nigerians to always exercise restraint on matters of religion. Free speech is no longer free if it amounts to religious provocation. Even the European Court has ruled that the utterance of derisive statements against the prophet of any religion is a crime.“We affirm clearly, categorically and unequivocally that there is a symbiotic relationship between provocation, violence and extremism. While MURIC will not condone extremism and violence, the anatomy of terrorism is becoming clearer day by day. We must all ponder over the causal-effect theory. Violence and terrorism are mere symptoms. The real disease is a provocation. Violence and terrorism are mere smoke. Provocation is the fire and we all know that there is no smoke without fire. “We, therefore, appeal to Nigerians to desist from insulting, deriding or abusing the prophets of other religions. Muslims should continue to respect Jesus (peace be upon him) whom the Christians hold very dear. In the same vein, Christians should avoid casting aspersion on the person of Prophet Muhammad (SAW). We have experienced enough religious crises in the land,"" the statement added.MURIC is an Islamic human rights organisation. http://saharareporters.com/2022/05/13/don%E2%80%99t-insult-prophets-other-religions-violence-terrorism-are-mere-symptoms-provocation",MURIC Condemns The Murder Of Deborah Samuel.

45,"AUDITORS, ETHICAL JUDGEMENT AND WHISTLEBLOWINGItsaso Barrainkua and Marcelo Espinosa-Pike  examined widespread claims that professionalism among auditors has decreased. The assumption was due to a shift in paradigms and particularly because the global audit market is mostly controlled by profit-seeking individuals, groups and organizations. The book focused on auditors’ commitment to professional ethics, independent enforcement and protection of public interest. Itsaso and Marcelo analysed the understanding of professional values among auditors at different stages of their career. The scholars also compared performance of research students and experienced auditors on independent enforcement to ascertain auditors’ ethical judgement and their commitment to public interest.Findings from the study show that students were more committed to independent enforcement and protection of public interest. But auditors tend to lower professional values as they climb the career ladder. In addition, results indicate that auditors possess higher ethical judgement than students. These two values—independent enforcement and public interest—however, precede ethical judgement.Itsaso and Marcelo suggested improvement of ethical decision-making in auditing and use of their recommendations in the education, hiring, and professional development of auditors.1.	WHISTLEBLOWING AND THE SAFETY OF PATIENTS DURING COVID-19The increased number of retaliatory attacks on whistleblowers during Coronavirus pandemic highlights the urgent need to re-orientate employees on their rights as stipulated in the Act. Moreover, ignorance on Dodd-Frank provisions among employees, and the financial cost to governments and tax-payers, calls for immediate strengthening of whistleblower protection structures. Therefore, global health workers—including employees in all sectors of global economies—should be able to speak out during COVID-19 for the purpose of drawing public attention to inadequate personal protection equipment (PPE) supplies and unsafe working conditions without being subjected to intimidation, attack, censorship or arrest . However, governmental systems in both US and UK, including other countries afflicted by the pandemic, have failed to provide health workers with the resources and protection they need to perform optimally. Although whistleblowing for inadequate supplies of PPE represents only one of numerous situations in which clinicians may opt to raise concerns, there is still lack of a streamlined, secure and robust communication channel through which employees in the healthcare sector can ensure patient safety. Further, systemic failures which expose employees to a bullying culture is a huge challenge that regulatory bodies are confronting with provision for anonymous reporting in order to protect informants from dismissal, harassment, and victimisation . Therefore, any whistleblower who believes he/she has been unfairly treated for making a disclosure may decide to take their case to an Employment Appeal Tribunal. The process usually involves at attempt by the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) to reconcile parties to the dispute.COVID-19 has therefore facilitated rapid redesign and redeployment of health workers, equipment, and services. Scientists and researchers around the world have also—through high professional standards—created clinical environments which guarantee quality care and patient safety as well as preserve human dignity . Yet, the role of whistleblowers in maintaining ethical and legal standards remains unarguably crucial.2.	CONCLUSIONThis academic research will add more to the body of knowledge by investigating the link between whistleblowing intentions and time of making a disclosure. Further, to understand the correlation between fraud and employees’ knowledge of Dodd-Frank, the researcher will explore relevant study materials on external and internal whistleblowing from the inception of Dodd-Frank in an environment where financial rewards increase as more fraud cases are reported. The study will also examine the gap between perceived knowledge of the Act and anti-regulatory behaviour. Results of the study will help organizations and SEC to create more effective policies that encourage, reward and protect whistleblowers. Basically, protection of whistleblowers is of great benefit to modern-day societies, thus, governments and organizations have the responsibility to develop tools that encourage whistleblowing .But despite the effectiveness of Dodd-Frank and Sarbanes Oxley Act (SOX) in the U.S., whistleblowing in Britain’s NHS  and all sectors is minimal because the UK government rejects the idea of monetary rewards—with emphasis on the moral aspect of whistleblowing. Although the European Union (EU) Directive does not prevent EU member states from offering financial compensations, it made no provision/reference to the issue of benefits. This highlights the need for countries to adapt customized solutions capable of solving their unique socio-economic problems instead of borrowing ineffective and time-wasting tools for controlling fraud.

46,"Sources at the presidency disclosed that nine of the ministers were hoping to hang on to their positions, until the president dropped the bombshell directing them to resign by Monday.By Bisi Abidoye  Even after President Muhammadu Buhari held a valedictory session on Friday for 10 ministers who had declared interest in elective offices, some of them are still scheming to hang on to their offices, PREMIUM TIMES’ can authoritatively report.The president held the session for ministers who had picked the expression of interest and nomination forms to participate in the primaries of the All Progressives Congress (APC).According to the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mihamned, the outgoing ministers that attended the session were Rotimi Amaechi (Transportation), Chris Ngige (Labour and Employment), Godswill Akpabio (Niger Delta Affairs), Ogbonnaya Onu (Science and Technological Innovation), Timipre Sylva State for Petroleum Resources), Tayo Alasoadura (State for Niger Delta Affairs), Pauline Tallen (Women Affairs), Uche Ogar (State for Mines and Steel Development), Abubakar Malami (Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice) and Emeka Nwajuba (State for Education), who was absent but with a permission.At the time of that event, only three of the ministers had submitted their letters of resignation.Six of the ministers had declared interest in the presidential race, two in governorship races and two in senatorial races.However, hours after the valedictory session, Mr Ngige issued a statement to announce his withdrawal from the presidential race and his intention to remain in his position as Minister of Labour and Employment.In the letter, Mr Ngige said: “Today, 13th May, 2022, I had an audience with the President, Muhammadu Buhari as a follow up to the one I earlier had with him on 11th May, 2022.“Having also consulted widely with my family, constituents, supporters and well-wishers, it is my pleasure to announce the withdrawal of my interest and earlier decision to contest the office of the President in the 2023 general elections.“As a result of this, will NOT be participating in any of the internal party processes of the said election, starting with the primary. took this momentous decision firstly in the overall interest of the nation, in order to enable me concentrate on my job, and assist the President and the Government, whether the difficult last lap, in the life of the administration and secondly for other family reasons.“I have since communicated this decision to the President and the Secretary to the Government of the Federation.”Also, Mr Malami, who earlier on Friday had tweeted that he had submitted his resignation letter, later deleted the tweet, sparking speculations that he had withdrawn the letter.Sources at the presidency disclosed that nine of the ministers were hoping to hang on to their positions, until the president dropped the bombshell directing them to resign by Monday.According to the sources, the president was aware of their reluctance to leave and had for over a week blocked them from seeing him. The sources all asked not to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the issue.“It is unlikely that the president will allow them back, not even Ngige who has issued a public statement on his withdrawal from the presidential race,” one of the sources said, adding, “They are just wasting their time.“The president knew they wanted to have their cake and eat it so he waited for them to commit themselves by picking the nomination forms before asking them to leave.“Only the Minister of State for Education, Nwajiuba, resigned on his own volition. All the others planned to keep their positions. They were relying on the provision of the Constitution which requires political appointees to leave about three months to the elections.“The president initially gave them until Monday to resign but shocked them again by summoning them to the valedictory session on Friday, even though only a few of them had submitted their resignation letters by then.”According to the sources, the president invited only the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, to the ceremony, apart from the departing ministers.At the valedictory session on Friday, Mr Buhari said he would be quick in appointing replacements for the departing ministers who he wished good luck in their political ambitions.As of Friday night, sources said Mr Malami had not turned in his letter of resignation, even though he is considered favourite to pick the APC governorship ticket in Kebbi.The former minister ignited consternation across the country after it was reported that he donated 30 Mercedes and Toyota Prado SUVs to APC officials and statutory delegates in the state.Mr Malami had been pursuing the removal of Section 64(12) of the Electoral Act 2022 which requires political appointees to resign before they can participate as delegates or candidates in party primaries.After a high court in Umuahia, Abia State declared the section unconstitutional, Mr Malami said he would immediately expunge it before gazzetting the Act.However, the National Assembly appealled the judgement, following which the Court of Appeal nullified it, although it also agreed that the section is unconstitutional.https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/529623-intrigues-as-ministers-develop-cold-feet-over-resignation.htmlLalasticlala",Intrigues As Ministers Develop Cold Feet Over Resignation

He added, “I was shocked that even the zone the entire South-East supported in unity including myself in 2011 and 2015 respectively, has the highest number of contestants without thinking of their brothers, knowing fully well that the South-East zone has remained the only zone in Southern Nigeria that has not produced the nation’s president since the rotation convention dispensation that began in 1999.“Coming to this late hour to support the South-East is rather suspicious to me if they couldn’t do it two years ago. The truth is, Chief Edwin Clark, knows the South-East cannot get the ticket of any party in an open contest as it is today without a gentleman agreement to concede it to the South-East.”The chief whip of the upper chamber explained that a number of the members of the Peoples Democratic Party were secretly supporting a candidate from the North-East so that the South-East might produce the next president in eight years instead of waiting for 16 years.He added, “It is rather surprising to me that Chief Edwin Clark didn’t call the majority of other Southerners including governors working against the South-East to order or the names he called me.“What did you say or do when all the aspirants from South-South and South-West were buying forms to run against South Easterners who have always supported them.“I know some people want us to keep quiet and then allow other Southerners to take the turn of South-East. If you meant well for the South-East, you could have discouraged other aspirants from running for President. Nothing stops the South from supporting only presidential aspirants from the South-East. The betrayers are those who don’t care about the South-East. We are wiser.”https://punchng.com/why-south-east-cant-get-presidential-ticket-kalu-replies-clark/",2023: Why South-East Can’t Get Presidential Ticket - Kalu Replies Clark

54,"Osinbajo Condemns Killing Of Deborah Samuel In SokotoI must say that the killing of Deborah Samuel is a deeply distressing thing, very disturbing - such an attrocious killing of the young lady by a mob who took the law into their own hands. It is very unfortunate.The President has reacted to this, a statement which was issued earlier condemning the action.The swift reaction of the Sokoto State Government and also the Sultan of Sokoto is highly commendable. Their swift reaction to the situation clearly demonstrated the outrage of millions of Nigerians and also demonstrated the desire of everyone to ensure that the perpetrators are quickly apprehended and prosecuted. As the President said, there’s really no excuse for anyone to take the law into their own hands no matter the provocation, there are set processes for ensuring that we are able to redress whatever wrongs that are done against us.We must express our condolence to the family of the young lady Deborah Samuel. I can't imagine how her parents, siblings and members of her family feel, not just about her death, but the very horrendous nature of its occurrence. It is very sad indeed, and I extend our sincere condolences to them. I ask that the Almighty will comfort them at this time.",Osinbajo Condemns Killing Of Deborah Samuel In Sokoto

The windy background on the bishop’s end of the call confirmed he was indeed on the move.The Gazette could not independently verify if the respected religious leader was being smuggled out of the state for his safety at the time of filing this report.A spokesman for the police in Sokoto did not immediately comment on the destruction of St Bakhita. The police fired teargas to disperse protesters from breaking into the church earlier in the day, but the attackers regrouped after the police vans left the neighbourhood, witnesses said.Meanwhile, Governor Aminu Tambuwal has imposed a curfew over Sokoto to curb further spread of violence amid a mob rampage for the release of Ms Samuel’s murder suspects.Ms Samuel, a 200-level home economics student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, was killed at about 9:00 a.m. Thursday for allegedly criticising Prophet Muhammad.Her killing has sparked nationwide outrage, with political and religious leaders demanding urgent arrest and prosecution of all suspects.https://server6.kproxy.com/servlet/redirect.srv/sruj/saqyqghtpry/p2/rampaging-thugs-raze-bishop-kukahs-catholic-headquarters-in-sokoto/",Bishop Matthew Kukah's Headquarters In Sokoto Attacked & Burned Down

She also rebuked attacks from other of her colleagues who attacked her for the alleged disparaging remarks.The school authorities reportedly summoned and detained her at the security axis of the institution before irate fundamentalist arrived, dragged her out, stoned and set her remains ablaze.Absolving Islam as the cause of the gruesome murder, Mr Oluoma on Friday said the incident should be attributed to the failures of justice and governance structures in the country.The priest, known as Fada Oluoma on Facebook, said giving the incident a religious coloration will absolve the authorities from their incompetence.“Let’s be clear on this heinous crime that took place in Sokoto state, it is not a religious problem, no one should even attempt to cheapen it with stupid religious coloration,” the cleric clamoured. “It’s purely a legal and governance issue.“If the Nigerian state cannot prosecute day light murderers in whatever guise, then it cannot make a claim to legitimacy. Only a failed state will not arrest and prosecute such audacious murderers and their enablers.“We must direct our anger at the government and hold it responsible for justice. Making this a religious issue is tantamount to absolving government from it’s responsibility,” he added.Meanwhile, the Imam of Abuja National Mosque, Ibrahim Maqari, has justified the stoning and roasting of the deceased student, adding that her killers should not be blamed for murdering Ms Deborah whom he accused of crossing the Islamic redline.https://todaypoliticsng.com/catholic-priest-absolves-islam-from-deborahs-murder-names-culprits/","Catholic Priest Absolves Islam From Deborah’s Murder, Names Culprits"

""If Deborah had been a Fulani Christian they won't kill her in that manner. What we are seeing is a prelude to greater chaos the Fulani wish to unleash on Nigeria before the 2023 Presidential election to create a state of siege so as to justify tenure extension or a state of emergency in the country.""AOKOYA urges Estates, Community Development Associations, (CDAs), Pan Yoruba groups to work together to form a formidable resistance against the possible attacks by the fanatics.The group said the terrorists  at present occupy strategic places in Yorubaland including Mile 12, Mile 2, Lagos-Ibadan Highway, Sabo in Ibadan and Ile Ife, Ilorin while Yoruba highways and farmlands they have taken over.

89,"Nuruddeen Lemu, the director of research and training at the Islamic Education Trust and Da’wah Institute of Nigeria in Minna, has in effect condemned the extra-judicial killing of Deborah Samuel by explaining in detail why muslims should not defend it. Read the explanation below:CONSEQUENCES OF EXTRA JUDICIAL KILLINGSIf we continue to defend and justify people who take the law into their own hands, because we feel so hurt by the words and actions of others (against Islam or our beloved Prophet - pbuh), and because we don't trust the justice system, we will find it very difficult to blame any violent ethnic or religious group in Nigeria who also take the law into their own hands because they feel aggrieved by the words and actions of others, and because they too don't trust the justice system. Extrajudicial punishments and killings that are justified for one crime, soon become justified for other crimes. There is nothing new or surprising about that! What justified killing one person, soon justifies killing 20. If instead of focusing on and improving the justice system, we decide to justify taking legal authority out of their hands, and putting it in the hands of angry mobs, we risk a state of anarchy/ fitna . If things go further out of hand, there will be no state apparatus that can control the anarchy because we would have done what was needed to disempower the state completely. We run the risk of sliding into a state of emergency ( darurah ) that will force the government to curtail more freedoms and rights in the name of ""national security"". It takes us into a future that is far worse than the bad situation we are already in.We will, with all our love for Allah and the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) end up creating a society that is the exact opposite of what we hoped our faith would lead us towards. We will instead if we are not careful have more blasphemy - the very thing that has aggrieved us! We will probably have more imprisonments and more extra-judicial deaths by more mobs. We will have more angry congregations, more social disorder and some mosques and churches closed down. Definitely more security challenges. We will endanger the freedom to practice our faith, which we currently have, if we do not choose to handle cases of blasphemy, in a manner that is consistent with Islamic law. And if the recent past has lessons for us, it would be that we could easily create the perfect environment, religious narratives and grievances needed, for the rise and support of more violent extremist groups. Who else, besides Shaitan and opportunists, happily benefits from the fitna/civil strife of anarchy?! Who gains?!How can our anger and indignation about blasphemy, be a justification for throwing away a system for dealing with crimes and offences. The Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) and all the great classical jurists (fuqaha) of all schools of Islamic jurisprudence, have categorically asked us to maintain and follow the rule of law, and respect for constituted legal authority. And if the system is imperfect and cannot be trusted, how is it a better idea to start a new ""system"" that is far far far worse than what we currently have?!How can placing legal, judicial and executive authority in the hands of mobs be a solution?!? How does it help to replace an imperfect justice system with the anarchy of angry mobs?!?How can we pray for peace, while simultaneously perpetuating a system that will most effectively destroy it?!How is it Islamic to replace bad with that which is far worse and evil? How is it more Islamic to choose the greater of two evils?!?Is it not even an Islamic legal maxim that states, ""avoiding harm takes precedence over accruing benefits""?!? And what exactly is the clear benefit of permitting extra-judicial punishments and mob action?!? Should we not instead do all within our power to address the flaws of the judicial system; to call upon those vested with the judicial authority to deal with hate speech and acts of blasphemy?!? Let us seek and support Islamically acceptable ways of seeking redress for all wrongs and crimes. And mob action is definitely not one of them!Let us please focus on improving the justice system. Let's call upon them and only them, to do what only they should do. ""And beware of a tribulation that may not be limited to the wrongdoers among you... "" (Qur'an 8:25) Peace be upon you.

90,"The Islamic State-backed faction of Boko Haram, the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), formerly known as Jamā'at Ahl as-Sunnah lid-Da'wah wa'l-Jihād, has released photographs of militants belonging to the sect observing Eid-el-Fitr prayers at different locations in Nigeria. Eid-el-Fitr was celebrated by most Muslim faithful across the globe on May 2.According to some of the photos sighted by SaharaReporters, the insurgents were seen in different groups praying together in open fields. In the photographs, small children were also seen praying alongside their fathers.The Nigerian army had on several occasions claimed the insurgents use children as human shields and child soldiers in their quest to weaken military operations. ISWAP is known for releasing similar photographs during Sallah celebrations. President Muhammadu Buhari had in a series of tweets in commemoration of Eid-el-Fitr claimed Boko Haram has been downgraded by his administration. While the fight against the insurgents has been tough and long, victory, Buhari said, was within reach. “After a period of fasting and reflection, this year, we have cause to welcome the occasion in hope. The battle waged against terrorists who falsely masquerade under the name of Islam is approaching its conclusion,” he had said. “The fight has been long and hard. Final victory is within sight. Boko Haram and its offshoots’ final embers are now fading. Last month, the leader of ISWAP was killed in an airstrike. Since the New Year, thousands of fighters have surrendered. “The territories they used to occupy are now seeing the return of those who were forced to flee their barbarity. Normality is finally beginning to return to the Northeast. It is a long process. Yet it is one we are, together, now embarking upon. “With the designation of bandit groups as terrorists, the challenges of banditry & kidnapping are being tackled differently in the north-west and north-central where the latest military acquisitions and armed forces are being fanned out across the region to thwart acts of terror.” Boko Haram and its offshoot, ISWAP have become more ferocious in recent times. The Nigerian Army has repeatedly claimed that the insurgency has been largely defeated. The terror group has caused the death of tens of thousands of people and the displacement of millions of others mainly in the North-East states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe.http://saharareporters.com/2022/05/05/boko-haram-terrorists-mock-president-buhari-nigerian-army-openly-observe-eid-el-fitr",Boko Haram Terrorists Openly Observe Eid-el-Fitr Prayer (Pictures)

The constituted authority must be allowed to deal with such matters when they arise.“No person has the right to take the law in his or her own hands in this country. Violence has and never will solve any problem,"" said the President.President Buhari also directed the Ministries of Information and Culture, Police Affairs and that of Communications and Digital Economy to work with GSM providers and Tech companies to help contain the spread of false and inflammatory information through social media.The President extended the nation’s condolences to the family of the deceased student and wished all those injured a quick recovery. He commended the immediate response to the incident by the Sokoto State Government and urged religious and community leaders to call citizens’ attention to the need to exercise the right to freedom of speech responsibly.President Buhari called for tampered comments by the media and calm among the general population while investigation is ongoing to find out the remote and immediate causes of the incident.Garba ShehuSenior Special Assistant to the President(Media & Publicity)May 13, 2022https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1579990115717419&id=100011193364134&sfnsn=scwspwaCcMynd44dominiqueLalasticala","President Buhari Reacts To Sokoto Killing Blasphemy, Reveals Next Line Of Action"

Primus Odili would approach each contract signing process with a demand for 25% of the total contract value to be paid into a specified bank account. “He would give the impression it was for the Governor”. All the road contracts executed during the 4year period as mere exercise of money laundering and/or transfer from the government treasury into unknown private accounts, explained the source. The construction of the roads at Aguleri Uno/Aguleri Otu at an estimated cost of N25 billion presents a classic example. Primus Odili presented two bank accounts from Zenith and UBA where the sum of N6,250,000,000.00 [N6.25billion] was paid into in multiple batches.Some of the major road projects executed by the Obiano administration of which Primus Odili imposed the 25% kickback comprise of the following – Orumba/Achala Road, Adazi Ani road, NTA-Nawgu-Ukwulu Road, Nimo/Abagana road, Oluoghoha road in Ihiala, Umuabuchi road in Uli, Orsumuohu road, Jerome Udoji road Ozubulu, Ezira/Umuomaku, Achina road, St. Peter University/Onneh, and Isuofia road.In addition to the kickbacks collected from the road projects, Primus Odili collected the sum of N1,770,000,000.00 [N1.77billion] from Obiano’s pick a project initiative for each community of the [one hundred seventy seven] 177 towns of Anambra State. The Obiano administration initiative earmarked the sum of N20million for each community. Each of the communities was given the freedom to choose their project. The administration remitted the monies directly to the contractors.  Through this initiative, a project worth N20,000,000.00 [N20million] was executed for each community per year for a period of two years. As has become customary, Primus Odili played a figurative role in the process and execution of the initiative. He was the key player behind the scene whom all the commissioners and advisers to the Governor deferred to – believing he was the eyes and the ears of the Governor.","How Obiano’s Former Aide, Primus Odili Stole Over N200billion From Anambra Coffe"

The mega dollars which then came with the discovery were not impacted on the area where the crude was coming from.His father, Pepple Boro, was a school headmaster and in his autobiography, ‘The Twelve Day Revolution’, Isaac Adaka Boro described how he moved with his parents to different towns whenever his father was transferred to head a school.The young Boro did not find any difficulty in obtaining the first First School Leaving Certificate which examination he passed with distinction. He also passed the West African School Certificate Examinations at Hussey College, Warri, in 1957. Isaac Adaka Boro produced the best school certificate result for the college in that year.After completing his secondary education in Warri, Delta State, he took up a teaching job before he joined the Police force. In 1961, he obtained a scholarship from the Eastern Regional Government to study Chemistry at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka.Isaac Adaka Boro emerged as the President of the Students’ Union Government for the 1964/1965 session after two failed attempts. This was his first major role in a leadership position that made him very popular.He was so radical and courageous that as a student, he dragged the Federal Government to court seeking the nullification of the 1964 general elections. He was also the pioneer for campus transportation which was hitherto nonexistent in the university. Boro paid attention to the unending political crises in Nigeria and spent more time reading the thoughts of known revolutionaries like Fidel Castro.When he left UNN in 1965, he moved to Lagos and founded a political movement called, WXYZ with two like-minds, Samuel Owonaru and Nottingham Dick. The movement advocated greater control of the benefits of oil wealth for the Ijaw.On February 23, 1966, Isaac Adaka Boro declared the secession of the Niger Delta from the rest of the country.Boro, who was said to have a strong admiration for Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, condemned the coup that led to his assassination and said Major-General Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi’s emergence as Head of State convinced him that revolution was the only way out for the Ijaw people and advocated a rejection of the new regime.He questioned the legitimacy of such a violent change and needless show of disrespect for the Nigerian Constitution, describing it as a direct affront on the covenant of federalism agreed on by the founding fathers of the country.Notably, a few weeks after that military coup, Boro declared the secession of the Niger Delta from the rest of Nigeria.",A week of  celebrations in honour of Isaac Adaka Jasper Boro!

Today we have all our public universities closed down for several months,” Atiku said.“Our children have been out of school. Not because we have not instituted institutions during PDP to make sure there is enough funding for these institutions.“But because they are stealing the money.

It is very important,” he queried.“Today, we have found ourselves in a similar situation because the APC government has been a one-sided government and therefore, there is disunity, because of disunity now we are facing insecurity all over the country.“That was why in my declaration speech, I said number one item for me is to make sure I unify this country.“I will give a sense of belonging to each and every part of this country; I’ll give a sense of belonging to every ethnic group; I’ll give a sense of belonging to every religious group. After unifying the country, then we tackle the insecurity.“Unless we restore law and order and peace, we cannot do anything. After restoring security generally, we will now go to the economy. We have the experience. We took Nigeria from the bottom to the highest economy in Africa.“Now APC has taken us down to the bottom, top to bottom. That is why I just can’t understand how somebody can vote for APC in this country because we have suffered and we are suffering.”He called for unity among members and supporters of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to ensure the party emerges victorious across all levels during the 2023 general elections.“PDP must unite to win this time. It does not matter the outcome of the convention.

The plaintiffs in their originating summons filed want the court to determine whether being Nigerians covered by Sections 66, 177 and 182 of the 1999 constitution can be subjected to any other conditions, rules or guidelines for the purpose of election into the office of the Governor of Bauchi State and House of Representatives respectively by APC under section 221 of the Constitution other than the qualifications and criteria set out in sections 66, 177 and 182 of the Constitution.They also ask the court to determine whether being card-carrying members of the APC and political appointees,  they can be prevented or barred from participating in its political convention, congress or primaries merely because they are political appointees.2023: Emefiele ‘ll resign on moral grounds, not law, says OzekhomeLawyer to the CBN governor, Dr Mike Ozekhome (SAN),  in an interview with  The PUNCH, insisted that his client would only resign on moral grounds and not on points of law. He however said the decision to quit would be left to the President and Emefiele.Emefiele had through Ozekhome applied for an order of status quo ante bellum to be made against INEC and AGF so that he would not be made to resign from office until 30 days to the 2023 general elections.The plaintiff in an ex-parte application had also denied being a political appointee but a public servant not caught by section 84 (12) of the new Electoral Act 2022.The CBN governor had asked the court to invoke Section 318 of the 1999 constitution to bar the defendants from asking him to vacate office until 30 days to the February 2023 Presidential election.Emefiele had expressed apprehension that the sale and submission of the presidential nomination form would expire on Wednesday and that unless the INEC and AGF were ordered to maintain status ante bellum as of May 5 when he filed the suit, he would be made to vacate office before his form would be accepted by the appropriate authority.But Ozekhome told The PUNCH that while the choice to resign was left for the Presidency and his client, the CBN governor would only resign on moral grounds and not on points of law.He said, “Whether he (Emefiele) goes or not is his own decision, he has told me to take up the legal aspect for him, that if he wants to go at all, he is entitled to stay in office 30 days to the general elections.“But it is now left for him to go even before the case is decided or after. But at least the law would have decided.“Yes, it (resignation) is left for him but not because of legal requirements. If he wants to go,  it will be on moral ground, not because the law says he must go now.Emefiele not a political appointee – Lawyer“We are talking of the constitution here, we are talking of Section 137 (1g) and Section 318 of the constitution which makes him a public officer and the Court of Appeal decision that Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act is unconstitutional and that Section cannot even apply to him because Emefiele is not a political appointee within the meaning of Section 84 (12).“If he decides to go, it will be on moral ground not on the legal or constitutional ground because the law does not say he must go. It is entirely his own decision and the decision of the President who appointed him not because that is the position of the law.“The Court of Appeal yesterday (Wednesday) said Section 84, Sub-section 12 of the Electoral Act (as amended) is unconstitutional for being inconsistent with Section 42 Sub-section 1 of the 1999 constitution which gives the right to freedom of assembly and association.“But our argument actually goes beyond that;  our argument is that Section 84, whether it was validated or not, does not apply to Godwin Emefiele, that section applies only to political appointees, Godwin Emefiele is not a political appointee, Godwin Emefiele is a public officer within the meaning of Section 318 of the constitution of Nigeria. “And by virtue of Section 137 Sub-section 1(g), a public officer like Emefiele is only required by the constitution to give 30 days notice before the presidential election which is slated for  February 25 2023, that is the position of the law.“The question of whether Emefiele will leave office during this case, before the case is ended or after the case, is entirely left to him and the President who appointed him. I wasn’t briefed to handle the moral and administrative angle to this case, I was briefed to handle only the legal and constitutional area and that is what I have just told you, that is the position of the law.”PDP, others join Emefiele’s suitA new twist emerged at the Federal High Court in Abuja on Thursday evening as the Peoples Democratic Party and two others joined in the suit by  Emefiele, seeking to enforce his right to participate in the 2023 presidential election without re-signing.The court had on Monday adjourned to Thursday to enable INEC and the AGF to appear before it to explain why the court should not restrain them from preventing the CBN Governor from realizing his political ambition by participating in all the processes leading to the 2023 presidential election.However, when the matter was called on Thursday, both INEC and AGF were in court in line with the order of the court.However, instead of proceeding with the case of the CBN Governor, two lawyers stood up to announce appearances for their clients.First was Chief Sebastiane Hon, (SAN), who informed the court of the intention of his client, the PDP to join as an interested party, which was immediately followed by one John Martins and Olukunle Ebun, who told the court that they were sueing for themselves and on behalf of the Save Nigeria our Fatherland.Responding, Emefiele’s lawyer, who did not oppose the applicants joining the suit, undertook to serve the applicants with all processes within 24 hours.After a meeting with Buhari at the Presidential Villa on Thursday, Emefiele told journalists that his fate was still being decided as regards the controversies surrounding his presidential bid.This is as he said that despite the current outrage by Nigerians, the main opposition, PDP, and the international community, he was ‘having fun.’Following his meeting with the President on  Thursday, the CBN Chief told State House Correspondents “there will be news”.The Governor had earlier gone to court to challenge the public service rule that requires public office holders to resign their positions before contesting for elective positions.Asked to respond to reports that Buhari had directed him to resign he said: “There is no news now, but there will be news. You heard me, I said there is no news but there will be news”.When confronted with the notion that his current position as a presidential aspirant and CBN governor is a major point of concern for the Nigers and even the international community, Emefiele noted “Let them have heart attacks. It’s good to have a heart attack. I am having a lot of fun.”The main opposition, PDP, after its 96th National Executive Committee meeting on Wednesday night restated its call for Emefiele’s sack, arrest and investigation.Speaking shortly after the meeting the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, said “NEC restated the call by the Party for the immediate resignation, arrest and prosecution of the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Mr Godwin Emefiele, for alleged manipulations and financial impropriety in the CBN which contributed to the collapse of our national economy.Buhari’s resignation order to save APC, candidates from loss – PresidencyIn a related development, the Presidency on Thursday said political appointees contesting in the 2023 general elections were asked to resign to save the APC  from doom in the controversy over Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022.According to the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, the ruling APC is playing safe until the Supreme Court gives the final interpretation of the controversial section of the Act.Adesina, while speaking on Politics Today, a current affairs programme on Channels Television, on Thursday, recalled how the President issued the directive at the Federal Executive Council meeting on Wednesday.He said, “The FEC meeting had held and we were closing. That was when the President now addressed the gathering, that some were interested in running for positions. He was specific about the position of the President.  He said those who had collected forms to run for the Office of the President, that it was advisable that they tendered their resignation. And it was in good order for those who had purchased forms to run and for the government.“One, those who had signified their interest to run could concentrate in their ambitions. If they stayed in the government and they were running their ministries, and then they were also running  their political campaigns, it is a distraction. They can’t concentrate. So, it was in their interest that the President said that. (Two), it was also in the interest of the government in that government’s work would not suffer.https://punchng.com/jonathan-submits-apc-forms-friday-emefiele-shuns-resignation-calls/","Jonathan Submits APC Forms Friday, Emefiele Shuns Resignation Calls - Punch"

How can humans and animals be struggling for a right of way in the Federal Capital City of Abuja?” the actor had asked.“We must move on to the 21st-century system of animal husbandry to reduce tensions between passers-by, commuters, farmers, and herdsmen.”A critic replied at the actor, putting it to him that he had campaigned for Buhari-led administration.In his reply, Okonkwo stated that he is still proud to have campaigned “relentlessly” and supported Buhari’s government.“Yes, I did and I stand by my decision. When I see that the second niger bridge is about to be completed. When I see that runway at Enugu Airport has been expanded to accommodate international flights,” the actor added.“When I see that Enugu-PH express roads are being rehabilitated, when I remember all other things Buhari had done for the South East and remember that PDP was there for 16 years and did nothing for us.“I am proud of the decision I took and I have no apologies for that. Nothing changed.“I have been a strong advocate of ranching from day one. Just check through my antecedents. I support the truth at all times.

121,"The race for the 2023 presidency took a new dimension last Monday when the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, set the ball rolling with the announcement of his intention to contest for the country’s plum seat.Since his disclosure to President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa Abuja, the former Lagos State governor has become the most talked-about politician in the country. Issues around him – negative and positive – have been dominating the social media even as news stories and articles about his person flood Nigerian national dailies.The declaration by Ebonyi State Governor Dave Umahi, 24 hours after, through the same channel and at the same place, could not dwarf the discussion around Tinubu, the Lion of Bourdillon.  Asiwaju is regarded as the kingmaker in the APC by virtue of the role he played in the emergence of Buhari in 2015 and his influence in the South West geopolitical zone, especially Lagos State, where he has been producing the occupants of the Lagos State House since 2007, when his second term lapsed.While most of those who served as governors between 1999 and 2007 have lost their relevance in the political terrain, Tinubu has maintained his and even spread his tentacles to other parts of the country. His inroads into other parts of the country, pundits say, is to actualise his lifelong ambition for the presidency. However, to actualise it, analysts say he must overcome some hurdles.Getting Buhari to key into his bidDuring his recent interview on Channels TV, President Buhari, without mincing words, said he does not care about who succeeds him. Specifically, the president said, “2023 is not my problem; I don’t care who succeeds me, let the person come, whoever the person.”The statement punctured reports that there was a power-sharing understanding between him and Tinubu before the formation of the APC. Observers of the political scene, however, say for Tinubu’s ambition to sail through, he needs to get the president to key into the project. But reports from the villa showed that the president’s body language was not favourable to the candidature of the former Lagos State governor.  “Frankly, the thinking here is that he has been compensated for his efforts in 2014/2015 with the position of the vice president and others,” a source around the president once said during a discussion on Tinubu’s ambition. Another villa source said at all cost, Tinubu needs to recruit the president’s nephew, Malam Mamman Daura, for his project.“Don’t mind what he (Mamman) said on zoning in 2020, Asiwaju needs to reach out to him. The president listens to him more than any other person,” he said.Decimating the 3Bs plus MIn the last 19 months, the affairs of the APC have been under the control of three governors plus a minister. Since June 2020 when the Adams Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee (NWC) was dissolved, the party has been under the grip of Mai Mala Buni (Yobe), who chairs the caretaker committee; Atiku Bagudu (Kebbi), chairman of the Progressives Governors’ Forum (PGF) and Mohammad Badaru of Jigawa State. The Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, is said to be part of the clique of the three governors.According to analysts, the decimation of this clique now known as 3Bs plus M, is the second hurdle, the former Lagos governor needs to scale through to actualise his ambition. It is common knowledge in the party that the clique has gone far in their bid to edge Tinubu out from the race.Party sources said the delay in the conduct of the national convention was part of the plot by the three governors. To reduce their influence, those familiar with the politicking in the party, said, “It is either he gets the convention conducted or he gets the Buni-committee dissolved as soon as possible.”Zoning/micro zoningSince the country returned to civil rule in 1999, power had been rotating between the northern and the southern parts of the country, though not on any constitutional basis.However, insiders say the delay in the conduct of the APC convention is part of the plan to open the presidential contest to all.Although the Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Raji Fashola, had last year said there was an agreement to rotate the presidency between North and South at the formation of the party, there have been controversies over the issue in the party.At the moment, sources say there are clandestine moves to leave the presidential ticket open to all, including aspirants from the North.The representative of youths in the 13-member national caretaker committee of the APC, Barrister Ismail Ahmed, in a recent interview, said the attention of the party was on balancing not zoning.“You know this zoning issue has never been a thing like that. You shouldn’t forget that APC is not very big on zoning. It is very big on balancing, not necessarily zoning.“Because in our 2014 primaries, if you remember, December 2014 when we had primaries that President Buhari emerged, there were five people that contested for the presidency. “Only two of them were from the same zone, all the others were from different political zones – Atiku Abubakar (North East); late Dr. Samuel Nda Isaiah (North Central); Rochas Okorocha (South East) and former Governor Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso of Kano State and President Buhari (North West). “It was a hotly contested election,” he said.Pundits say Tinubu needs to get the ticket zoned to the South and micro zoned to the South West for him to have an upper hand.APC was formed in 2013 following the merger of the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP), a faction of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) and new PDP (nPDP).  Running mate/Muslim-Muslim ticketWho will be Tinubu’s running mate, should he pick the APC ticket? These are key questions nagging the minds of those promoting his candidature in the North and those who are against it. The main reason that stopped Tinubu from becoming the running mate of President Buhari in 2015 was his faith. Spirited efforts for him to be considered were thwarted at the last minute when many chieftains of the party kicked against a Muslim-Muslim ticket. Hence, he was given the opportunity to pick a Christian. This led to the emergence of Professor Yemi Osinbajo as Buhari’s running mate.A similar scenario is playing out. Top shots in the party, especially governors, who want to be his running mate, are Muslims. “This is one of the reasons two blocs in the party are against his candidature. So, who will he pick? If he picks a Muslim, it would affect the fortunes of the party at the poll. Likewise, if he picks a Christian, it will not fly,” a member of the party said.Health challengeOpponents of the candidature of the APC national leader are also using the issue of health to de-market him. They are warning against a repeat of the Buhari experience. In his first tenure, President Buhari frequented London for medication, where he spent months on one of such trips.Between August and October last year, Tinubu was in London for medical attention. Both Buhari and Tinubu were in London for medication issues last year. While Buhari was there for some days, Tinubu spent months. Buhari even visited the former Lagos governor. It was after the president’s visit that Duchess Mews, Portland Place, Central London home of Tinubu became a mecca of sorts as his political godsons, admirers and supporters thronged there to visit him.Though allies of Tinubu said he went for knee surgery, those against his aspiration are putting forth some other prognoses. Meantime, political watchers are stressing the need for the former governor to clear the air on his health condition. But a board member of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC), Senator Magnus Abe, dismissed insinuations by some people that Tinubu was too old and too sick to become the next president, saying age is not necessarily a factor in leadership.https://dailytrust.com/tinubu-hurdles-before-a-kingmaker-eying-the-throne",Tinubu: Hurdles Before A Kingmaker Eying The Throne

Babagana Monguno, has tasked heads of security and law enforcement agencies to step up close monitoring and profiling of political actors who exhibit tendencies to subvert the electoral process.Monguno disclosed this at the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) second quarterly meeting of the Inter-agency Consultative Committee on Election Security (ICCES) in Abuja on Friday.The NSA, who is also the co-chairman of ICCES, said that the political thugs and their sponsors would equally be under discreet surveillance for possible arrest and prosecution.Monguno, represented by Mr Sanusi Galadima, said that he had noted with utmost concern, the growing uncertainty heralding the conduct of party primaries for the 2023 general elections.“This is in addition to the unabated spate of violence that threatened the upcoming off cycle gubernatorial elections in Ekiti and Osun States, arising from internal party wranglings, increasing acrimony and bickering amongst political actors.“Also the inability of various contending political blocs to amicably resolves differences in line with democratic tenants.“Consequently, the above disturbing development has already culminated in intense power play capable of heightening unnecessary political tension across the country.“More worrisome is the unguarded utterances of some highly respected individuals and groups which more often than not amplify divisive narratives to the detriment of national security and stability.“ Accordingly, heads of security and law enforcement agencies have been task to step up close monitoring and profiling of political actors no matter highly placed who exhibit tendencies to subvert the electoral process, even as thugs and their sponsors would equally be trailed for possible arrest and prosecution,” Yakubu said.The NSA emphasised the need for INEC to impress it on political parties to consistently abide by prescribed rules as outlined in their respective constitutions.“This is to significantly reduce areas of conflict and ensure a peaceful atmosphere for a hitch free off-cycle and general election,” Monguno said.Earlier in his remarks, INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, said that the general security situation in the country and its impact on the electoral process was a source of concern to the commission.Yakubu said that the commission would continue to work with the security agencies to ensure the success of all forthcoming elections and electoral activities.He said that as INEC prepared for the 2023 General Election, it was also preparing for two off-cycle governorship elections in Ekiti State on June 18 and in Osun State on July 16.He said that INEC also had pending by-elections in 18 constituencies across the country involving three senatorial districts, one federal constituency and 14 state constituencies.Yakubu said that political parties were expected to end their primaries latest by June 3 and for their candidates to emerge for public campaigns nationwide.He said that immediately after this, INEC and the security agencies had their work clearly cut out ahead of the elections.“The general security situation in the country and its impact on the electoral process is a source of concern to the commission.“However, we are confident that with nine months to the 2023 General Election, there is enough time to respond to the security challenges and secure the nation for elections to take place nationwide. The timetable for the election has also been released.“Let us not wait until a few weeks to the election before we realise that time is not on our side and begin to seek for extension of timelines. The time to act is now.“We wish to reassure the security agencies that we will continue to work cooperatively with you to ensure the success of all forthcoming elections and electoral activities,” Yakubu said.He said that INEC had directed Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs) to provide basic data on areas of security challenges in their states, including information on citizens living in Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps.He said that the idea was to harvest the data as a basis for further engagement with the security agencies as well as devising the best way to provide electoral services to all Nigerians under all circumstances.“As you are all aware, a number of developments have taken place since our last meeting.“For instance, with the coming into force of the Electoral Act 2022, there are roles and responsibilities required of all involved in elections, especially in the areas of voter accreditation and result management in particular and election administration in general. All these have bearing on election security.“We therefore need a clear understanding of some of these responsibilities under the new law,’’ the INEC chairman said.Yakubu said that one of the agenda of the meeting was to agree on the Code of Conduct and Rules of Engagement for Security Personnel on Election Duty.He said that a further review was necessary in view of the new Electoral Act and current security challenges.“The commission will continue to appreciate the cooperation and support of all members of ICCES in our determination to conduct peaceful and credible elections.“Your support in providing security for the deployment of election materials, the protection of INEC officials, party agents, election observers, journalists and voters make democratic elections and related activities such as the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) possible,” Yakubu said.The meeting was attended by representatives of security and law enforcement agencies in the country.https://politicsnigeria.com/police-efcc-dss-political-aspirants/","Police, EFCC, DSS To Monitor And Profile 2023 Political Aspirants, Actors"
125,"Dear Nigerlites.There has never been a time when Nigerlites have to be extravigilant concerning their political future than now as the merchants of toxic politics have all but perfected their permutations to “Install” the Governor of the State in 2023.This is been done without a recourse to laid down procedures or even allowing democratic principles to prevail. Their actions have all the trappings of a stock exchange trading.What is gradually unfolding is an attempt to foist a candidate against the wishes of the rank and file of the party and being done with nauseating arrogance; without weighing the repercussions.This is being done, despite assurances at various engagements by the Governor, that he has no candidate and would allow the will of the people to prevail.These political merchants have ignored him, and they are who they are today not for any discernable contributions to the society but because of their proximity to government machinery.This suffocating grip is now being modulated to take over and muzzle any opposition in the party. Consequently, this would give them further ample access to levers of government for continued banditry on the finances of the state.This group of buccaneers making sure they do not lose their vice grip on Governor Abubakar Sani Bello who came onboard full of desire to change the development narrative of the state, have made sure their personal aggrandizement became the nucleus of governance.Today, Niger State is a pitiable recipient of all their failings, Nigerlites have to stand up collectively against another round of arrested development and submit in clear terms by resisting this move. It is ill- conceived, fraudulent, arrogant, selfish and has no basis in democratic realities of today.Nigerlites, would you stand aloof and allow this group to further impoverish and mortgage, the future of the State?.How do you expect individuals who have fed fat on our patrimony will now also want to become architects of our fate. Can we remain unconcerned that this macabre dance, that is not people factored to further aid the bleeding of the state and cover the nefarious activities of the past.We are not slaves to the past and shall not be new slaves of exploitation for them. NIGERLITES SHINE YOUR EYES.A roll call of these characters will show that they do not deserve any form of honour anywhere in the state.How can an individual who got a contract to build a massive house of Assembly Complex, with constant variations has not completed it four years on. The same goes for another who got a multi-billion naira turn around water contract in Bida, Minna and Kontagora since inception of this regime without completion. The people in these areas are still gasping for water. The renovation of Minna sports gymnasium awarded Six years ago has not been completed hampering the development of sports in the state.Niger State unlike Gombe, Bauchi and Kaduna states who are cardinal reference points of development have succeeded because they don’t have hawks surrounding their administration. They have always appointed commissioners, local Government Chairmen and other Political appointees. They control administrative affairs in Ministries where their men are despite direct control on the finances and personnel, there is no visible landmark or objective contribution that can be attributed to them anywhere in the state. It is this objectionable condition they want to perpetrate sentencing us to stone age existence and pittance.Do I have to mention the individual who got a rural electrification project that is yet to be completed 17 years on what of the serial betrayer who was given an ambassadorial posting, only to dump the party to contest governorship election with another party. Now he is back to the party, directing and projecting.They are now bold to make claims in billions for payment as the present regime draws to an end. We demand they provide incontrovertible evidence of projects executed to back up their claims.Nigerlites, are this kind of people who you want to trust? Is it not clear that what they want is to have another individual at their beck and call. Nigerlites are not considered in their political equation but driven by primitive sense of accumulation.Now is the time to let them know that the circumstances that gave the APC ascendency in 2015 has all but gone. New realities have taken over, new actors are on the scene, various political tendencies have emerged, voting demographics have changed, Peoples perspectives are now sky high. This is why we must not allow this cabal to hold us back.The time for change has finally come, Resist impositions, Let them have their say, but with our united front they will not have their way.BASHIRU ALIYUPublic Analyst Minna.cc: mynd44","2023, Nigerlites Beware Of Cabals"

Later her naked body was burnt in public.She is survived by her husband Femi and a son and daughter. According to the Voice of the Martyrs magazine her husband said of her death “[My children] are a constant reminder of my dear wife and how we both desire to raise them in the ways of the Lord.

Oluwasesin, a mother of two, was assigned to supervise an Islamic Religious Knowledge exam. When one of the students wanted to enter the exam hall with his books, Oluwasesin collected them and threw them outside. The students claimed that one of the books was a copy of the Qur'an, started to chant ""Allahu Akbar"" (Allah is Great) and chased her to the school principal's office. They dragged her out of the office, stripped her naked and stabbed her to death. They then burnt her corpse in a car, beat up the school principal, a Muslim, for offering refuge to her, and burned down three classroom blocks, the school clinic, the administrative block and the library. Gombe State Governor Mohammed Danjuma Goje  ordered the immediate closure of all secondary schools in the state and the deployment of soldiers and policemen to strategic points in the state, especially churches. The marauding students where only 12 - 14 years old and supposedly joined by members of a gang called Yan Kalare.Three persons were arrested in connection with the murder.

127,"2023: Egba Baales Endorse Segun Sowunmi Ahead Of Governorship Primaries The Baales in Egbaland, Ogun State, have thrown their weights behind the governorship ambition of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) aspirant, Segun Sowunmi.They took the decision through a voice vote after Sowunmi addressed them during a consultation meeting in Abeokuta over his gubernatorial bid.The Baales said Sowunmi understands their challenges and he demonstrated his readiness to address if elected governor.The Baales were drawn Obafemi Owode, Abeokuta South, Abeokuta North, Odeda, Ifo, Ewekoro, all Local Government Areas in Ogun Central Senatorial district.The President of Ogun State Council of Baales, Tunji Falola, in a voice vote, asked the Egba Baales, “Are you all in support of Sowunmi’s ambition for the governor of Ogun State?”, to which they responded in affirmative.Falola who is also the chairman of the Baales in Egbaland, applauded Sowunmi, also an Egba son, for his development blueprint especially as if affects the traditional chiefs.He said “We need to look for a capable leader, leader with integrity, who is able, can do it and do it well. There have leaders and leaders but where are they today? I am happy that Sowunmi is meeting us Baale for the first time now. A thousand and one others are still coming, I am sure of that.“But do they realize that Baales are at the grassroots and that they can call their people are say ‘this is where we are going and their people would agree’. Not all leaders realise that here we are today with Sowunmi amongst us, coming here first and foremost even before going to the Obas, to seek our opinion and cooperation on his agenda.”Earlier, the governorship aspirant called for devolution to the traditional chiefs in order to stem the tide of insecurity in the country.Sowunmi  noted that Baales are the first level of security in their areas and there is a need for an administrative and legal structures, empowering them to carry out their duties.   He Baales are not in contention with the monarchs and should be allowed to perform their roles to drive the security and development at the grassroots.  He said “I am particularly concern that we have not been able to find an administrative structure to accommodate Baales and take advantage of the closest they are to the people and the proximity to the land and it has cost us gravely.“Part of the reasons we have not been able to secure our fringes is because we have not given any responsibility to our Baales. It is time now to create a framework where the Baales will have bigger roles according to the procedures of  the service in such a way that we know that these are the responsibilities that they have and the wherewithal we have given them to be able to carry out the duties.“If we must be secured, if we must develop evenly, if we must be prosperous, then we must figure out how to devolve more powers to the Baales.”https://www.lagospostng.com/ogun-2023-egba-baales-endorse-segun-sowunmis-governorship-bid/",2023: Egba Baales Endorse Segun Sowunmi Ahead Of Governorship Primaries

The only person you should follow is the person who knows the road. Follow me, I know the road and I will not mislead you. They do not have my brains but I do have enough brains.”He continued, “Where is their track record? How many councillors, local government chairmen and chairperson, members of House of Assemblies, House of Representatives or senators have they produced? I have produced them.”Tinubu also wondered why there were many people contesting for the presidential ticket of the APC, wondering what their motivation was.“Too many people running, running, running; where are they running to?

But on my own, in terms of appointments, I tried to see that the way appointment was made, you will agree with me that the appointments we have made so far did not exclude any section.”He promised that he would not preside over a government that would margninalise any section of the country.Jonathan lauded the role of Yoruba elders in the 2011 presidential election, which enabled the PDP to win in the South-West saying that the success was made possible because of the leadership.On the request for the dissolution of the NDDC, Jonathan said though there were many complaints about the commission, it could not be dissolved because it was made up of management and staff.Jonathan restated his commitment to ensure that things were done differently in the country, adding that corrupt officials would no longer be allowed to go scot free, while outstanding performers would be rewarded.http://www.tribune.com.ng/index.php/news/27267-yoruba-elders-meet-jonathan-over-marginalisation",Yoruba Marginalization: Elders Met Jonathan To Complain - SMH

He went on to advise everyone to respect this boundary and avoid saying condescending things about the Prophet.His tweet seems like a reaction to the murder of a female Christian student of a College of Education in Sokoto state, who was beaten to death and burnt over allegations of blasphemy.The controversial politician tweeted,“There is no Muslim that don’t respect the sanctity and the divinity of Jesus Christ. And certainly, there is no Muslim that will ever tolerate denigrating our beloved Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W).Insulting him is our uncompromising REDLINE. Respect our sensibilities and avoid it.”A while ago, Adamu Garba took down the APC flag in his office.This comes days after he was unable to secure enough funds to purchase the N100 million presidential nomination and declaration of interest form of the party.The controversial politician who begged Nigerians for money to purchase the N100 million form but was only able to raise N83 million before the deadline, have had to forfeit his presidential aspiration.He took to his social media page to share a video of the moment he pulled down the APC flag from his office and wrote,“We joined APC for the sake of Nigerians, now that all is not looking straight.

148,"Lagos, Ogun only states that generate more IGR than FAAC allocation – ReportLagos and Ogun are the only two states out of 36 that made more Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) than the allocations received from the Federal Government in four years (2017-2020).This was disclosed in a report by a socioeconomic research firm, SBM intelligence, titled ” Taxing Nigeria’s subnational economies to oblivion”The firm also warned that the current condition of the states’ IGR is not healthy.What SBM is saying about states’ dependency The report revealed that “By 2018, Osun State had fallen off the list, as 2019 ” saw a huge positive change as Lagos, Rivers, Ogun and Delta all generated more internal revenue than they were fed by Abuja.“By 2020, we were back to just Lagos and Ogun generating more internal revenue received from Abuja.This state of affairs indicates that almost all of Nigeria’s federating units are not fiscally healthy”SBM warned that falling oil revenues have put states in precarious situations, leaving them unable to meet their basic obligations such as paying salaries, wages and pensions not to mention providing social services and infrastructure“This has increased the urgency of states to increase their internally generated revenue in order to reduce their exposure to volatile and unreliable federal allocations. Due to a limited number of taxable businesses in the states, many state governments end up focusing their efforts on the same businesses that are already paying their fair share of taxes.“In the end, this has the unintended effect of creating a harsh business environment for all and in some cases, forcing businesses to close due to overtaxation and/ or harassment,” it added.It also warned that Nigeria’s telecoms industry is disproportionately overtaxed by states, citing Kogi State, adding that the telecommunications companies are made to pay up to 41 levies by the state government, including levies.Some of the levies are annual right of way renewal; social services contribution; employee economic development levy; mast site premises renewal; fire service yearly renewal; payment of environmental levy; failure to submit an environmental impact assessment report; failure to register industry; failure to submit environmental audit report every two years; storage of petroleum products and radioactive materials without written permission from the Kogi State Environmental Protection Board and others.What you should knowAccording to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, the 36 states of the federation including the federal capital recorded a sum of N849.12 billion as internally generated revenue between January and June 2021, which is 38.5% higher than the N612.87 billion recorded in H1 2020 and 26% higher than N673.82 billion recorded in H2 2020.Lagos, Ogun States and FCT led the list with the highest internally generated revenue per population in the first half of 2021. This is according to analysis carried out by Nairalytics, the research arm of Nairametrics.Lagos State recorded the highest IGR in the review period with N267.23 billion accounting for 31% of the total IGR recorded in the period under review.The Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC), shared the sum of N725.571 billion to the three tiers of government, as federation allocation for the month of March.States received N227.201 billion, the local government councils got N167.910 billion, while the oil producing states received N53.356 billion as derivation (13 per cent of Mineral Revenue).https://nairametrics.com/2022/05/12/lagos-and-ogun-states-only-states-to-generate-more-igr-than-faac-report/","Only Lagos, Ogun Generate More IGR Than FAAC Allocation"

He said that the performance of Jafaar in the national assembly as the Lawmaker representing Mubi North, Mubi South, and Maiha has given APC a new acceptance in the area.He recalled that the Lawmaker has done a lot of empowerment to alleviate the socio-economy crisis the people of the area have passed through and still passing since Boko Haram has rampaged communities under the federal Constituency is representing.He described Haske Magaji as an all-around achiever in making bills, and motions and largely contributing to the development of the country.He called on delegates, party stakeholders, and Senior and critical party men not only from the Adamawa Northern zone but the entire state to rally around Jafaar for another term and for APC to win all elective positions.""I'm a die-hard APC Man with no reservations of my loyalty to the party, I'm here to categorically say that if Magaji can't get the ticket to return as our representatives, APC should forget about winning election in the zone.""

159," A man who refused to disclose his identity because of security reasons has narrated how his cousin brother who visited Nigeria for a burial from Switzerland was abducted by suspected gunmen of the Indigenous People Of Biafra.He said the abductors of his brother whose operational base is in Lilu in Anambra State did not hide their identity after he was ferried to their camp to pay a ransom of two hundred thousand naira for his brothers release.The gunmen according to his account, said that they resorted to kidnapping after Nnamdi Kanu was arrested in order to raise funds for their operations.Let me share this my experience with you guys for everybody to know that we are in serious troubles.At about 2pm on the 26th January, 2022, I got a call from my cousin who came back from Switzerland for a burial at Umuike Ukpor. He told me that he was under captivity of IPOB guys at Lilu. The IPOB guys told me to come with 200,000 naira and bail my brother and his SUV if I still want him alive. Initially, I thought it was a prank but when the call came again, I knew it was a serious matter They warned me not to involve police or else they will kill my brother. I called my boss in the office and told him what was happening and he adviced me not go. I also sought the opinion of my other friend who is a DSS guy, he asked me not to go. I called my elder sister and she warned me not to try itThey used another number to call me and directed me on how to come. I convinced myself that I should go and that nothing would happen to me. But my instinct continued telling me to go and save OkeyAs soon as I joined the St Joseph to St Joseph/Onuselogu road, one particular bike man started following me from Awka Etitit section I pretended that I wanted to buy fuel but the pump attendant told me that one man was calling me at the other side of the road. I also received a call from another number and I told them that I was on my way.I took my old Siena bus and withdrew 250k and moved. Surprisingly, the person asked me whether I was the person with the Siena and I answered in affirmative. He then asked me to stop at Hajosty Petroleum at Ukpor which I did.I came down, waited for further instructionsHe then told me that my brother was in safe hands only that MNK onye Ndu is in prison and there is no money to operate I walked to the other side and the man showed me my phone number and asked me whether I was the owner which I accepted. He then told me to buy him 2 bottles of Hero beer at a shop there which I did. I also took my own 2 bottles of Heineken beerI told him that I understood him perfectly well. He then told me to remove everything that bear Nigeria I have on me and keep them in my vehicle and I obliged him.RELATED POSTSNCC rejects MTN, Airtel, Glo, others’ request to increase call, SMS…Terror bandits slaughter 48 civilans in three Zamfara communities2023: INEC excludes 124 parties from participationThat’s why they deployed a way of raising money by kidnapping. He asked me to join him on his bike and we zoomed off from that Hajosty Petroleum UkporHe asked me to pick a Greenleaf and be waving it across my head as he drove into Lilu.That was when I knew that I was in trouble.We got to a a point where they used a trip of chippings to block the tarred road and they dug a deep gully after the chippings to prevent soldiers from entering with armoured tanks into Lilu.He drove for about 3 kilometers without seeing any life there except IPOB guys who were armed with various types of arms and dangerous weapons.The guy was on a neck breaking speed until he got to Lilu junction Orsumoghu. There is also a filling station there which I can not remember the name now. He stopped and went to the filling station to greet some fierce looking men. All of them were carrying AK 47 automatic rifles with cache of ammunitions.But they created a road in the bush where one could drive through but the road was seriously manned by IPOB guys. Several exotic cars were there. It is either their owners were killed or the owners ran away and abandoned themWhen we got to their camp, it was a gory sight.I was shocked to see a woman selling beer there and some girls who put spices to their lives were there singing and clapping.My Visa was the green leaf which identified me as a peaceful man.I bought them beer and they were 25 in numberI stayed there for 30 minutes before the GOC came out to see me. My brother was already pushed into their cell. They brought him out and knelt him down before me.As soon as the GOC saw me, he queried them why they brought me there. They told him that I came for my brother. He said that there was a grave that was following me. But everywhere was smelling like sewage or septic tank.I told him how I got a call and how I came to save my brother. He said that he liked my guts. He asked them to bring out my brother.He ordered 4 of his men to escort us to that Ukpor junction.The GOC told me to be praying for MNK to be released. I gave them what they asked me to bring and I also gave them 20k to drink.But most of them were speaking Abakaliki dialectThere is no life there now.Lilu town is like Sambisa forest now.The experience is not worth having for a second timeIt has been taken over by insurgents.We are in serious troubles in Anambra SouthThese guys are meanThey have Intel’s everywhereIt is very unfortunateIt is very unfortunateLilu, Orsumoghu, Azia, Isekke, Ukpor are in serious troublesThey are small boys.https://news.band/how-ipob-gunmen-in-anambra-kidnapped-my-brother-demanded-200k-ransom-man-narrates/Above is thier modus Oparandi. If after kidnapping they discover that you are working for the Nigerian army or police probably due to your ID card, you will be killed outrightly because that is a standing instruction from Nnamdi Kanu himself. Also because they have sworn to a war with security operatives due to the fact they believe these operatives killed their brothers.

162,"*The Egg is About to Be Broken Again**Tim Akano* Come, let us reason together, now that such exercise is still meaningful; before the sky gets dark and evil, and the falcon cannot hear the falconer.Today, the Nation’s Ship is on fire. The Elites are shopping for new furniture to equip the burning ship, instead of looking for water and C02 to put out the fires. ’No be juju be that’? Is a soft landing still possible for Nigeria at this stage, if yes, how? That is the exam. Let me unpack the seven variants of madness inside Nigeria’s elite backpack that confirm the egg is about to be broken from the outside. Why this analogy? You askYou see, when the egg breaks from inside, life begins, but when it breaks as a result of outside force, life ends. Before a State will collapse and disappear from the face of the earth, her Ship will pass through six harbours to load: Stagnation, Retrogression, Fragile, Failing, Failed and Disappearance. Which harbour is Nigeria’s Ship loading from presently? *Madness N0 1*:The ’TikTok Democracy’ that Nigeria is practising is a hallucination, it is not working and the ‘one-man-one-vote’ principle is a mirage. The vote of an idiot who adds zero value to the economy pays zero tax, zero education, and zero skill apart from voting skill carries the same weight as the vote of a man who pays tax and oils the wheel of the nation’s economy. Smart nations open schools, factories and Tank Farms, while Nigerian politicians open VOTERS FARMS, where voters are raised and cultivated like sheep. However you stack the cards, vertically or horizontally in a country where the uneducated young adults on the streets are more than the ones working in the factories and schooling, the Idiots will always have it. The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. Politicians breed and incubate the idiots, who in turn ‘’democratically’’ install one of their own as King. This is why. Nigeria is going downhill, from ‘’top to bottom’’. The Greeks have a word to describe this charade: IDIOCRACY. *Madness N02*:The life span of a multi-ethnic, multi-religious country forcibly held together and centrally administered is three scores and ten, then the superglue of force turns loose. As Nigeria approaches her 70th birthday, the Elites need to stop avoiding the thinking cap and see it instead, as an ally. For instance, the USSR with a population of 280 million people, a union of 15 Republics; 14 heavy-laden wives and Russia, the condescending husband, survived only for 69 years (1922-1991) before the union was dismembered. The first wife to file for divorce was Lithuania, followed by Georgia while Kazakhstan exited last on December 16th, 1991. The curtain fell on 26th December 1991, the Red Banner flag was lowered, and the USSR, which Russia boasted was indivisible and unconquerable, collapsed like a pack of cards. Today, Putin and the Russian elites exhibit symptoms of malarial dreaming, nursing the hopes that one day, USSR2 will resurrect. Similarly, the federal republic of Czechoslovakia (1918-1993) fumbled and wobbled until age 75, when she split into two distinct independent countries of the Czech Republic and Slovakia.Yugoslavia collapsed on the eve of her 74th birthday and violently split into 7 nations along ethnic and religious lines: Bosnia & Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia. Paradoxically, each of the 7 independent countries is richer than Yugoslavia. For instance, in 2022, Croatia per Capita Income (PCI) is $16,500, Serbia, $7,100. Kosovo $4,500, Slovenia $27,000, Macedonia $5,700, and Bosnia and Herzegovina $62,600, while Yugoslavia in 1991 was just $5000. When you unbundle any unbalanced federation, a branch can become bigger than the whole, through healthy competition or a combination of other variables. Sudan which gained independence on January 1st 1956 from the Anglo-Egyptian condominium was another failed union. Sudan had about 600 ethnic groups speaking over 400 languages. But by July 2011 at 55 years, the hitherto geographically largest country in Africa disintegrated and, from the ashes emerged two independent but antagonistic countries.What does all this add up to? That a multi-ethnic, multi-religious country forcibly yoked together and unitarily administered has a lifespan of about 70 years before it collapses. (69 +75+74+55/4= 68+years). Europe, the UK, USA knew what they were doing when they chose  loose Federation with a referendum clause in their respective constitution and focus on building factories and Tank Farms instead of Voters' farms. *Madness N03*:Approaching the crucial 2023 elections flimsily, clumsily and lousily as the elites are doing is dangerous. The new game is nationalism, the old game- globalisation is preparing to go on sabbatical. Every smart nation is seeking self-reliance. This is the wrong time for countries to engage in acts that may lead to a crisis. The superpowers who could separate warring nations are busy warring in Ukraine, Syria, Iraq Yemen etc. Finland and Sweden may soon join NATO and become the new battlefields, plus the threat of a WW3 becomes a strong possibility as the days go by. *Nigeria should be careful, lest she becomes collateral damage*. *Madness N04*:STAGNATION/RETROGRESSION: how can Nigeria be a dwarf despite her humongous resources? Let us search for truth from the thick forest of facts. In 1992, Nigeria’s per capita income stood at $2,030. As of May 2022, it is the same: $2,083. Little wonder why JPMorgan recently (10/5/22) removed Nigeria from its list of emerging markets, saying the country has not taken advantage of high oil prices, unlike the Saudi Aramco which overthrew Apple on 12th May 2022 to become the most valuable company in the world at $2.4 Trillion. For instance, UAE’s GDP has grown 112 times bigger than it was in 1971 with a per capita income in 2022 of $40,000. South Korea grew her per capita income from $10,170 in 1992 to $28,075 in 2022, while Singapore grew from $27,060 in 1992 to $61,000 in 2022.Wait for the bombshell: While 6 countries with a combined population of 183 million people generate $4.2Trillion in GDP, Nigeria with a population of 220million has a GDP of about $400B. (UAE: Population- 10m, GDP- $400B, Malaysia: Population- 33m, GDP-$366B, Israel: Population- 9.6M, GDP- $501B, Thailand: Population- 66m, GDP-$505B, South Korea: Population- 51.8M, GDP $1.8Trillion, and Taiwan: Population -23M, GDP $690B.*Nigeria is not productive and can barely fulfil her destiny as it is presently structured*. *Madness N05*:LACK OF ELITE CONSENSUS: All smart and developing nations have something in common: Elite Consensus around a common vision. India's elites decided to produce Software Engineers for the world. In 1950, three years after independence, the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was established. Today, Indian Engineers are leading the world and remitting about $100 Billion yearly according to MOIA. Taiwanese elites decided to control the heart of technology; in 1987, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) was established, and while it is considered to be a lesser-known company, in reality, rules the world. The same can be said for the UAE. Their elites built a consensus around Hospitality and Tourism, through Dubai. The Chinese elites built a consensus around Global Supply Chain (GSC), which catapulted China to N0 2 in the global classroom. *Here is the exam: who among the Presidential aspirants can govern any of these two countries successfully, and how*?Country A:  Four countries are merged under one unitary, central government: Saudi Arabia+ Israel + Iran+ Italy and form the *Federal Republic of SAIII*Country B: Pakistan+ India + Bangladesh+ Ireland become the *Federal Republic of PIBI**SAIII=PIBI=Nigeria. QED. You gerrit or fogerrabourrit.*Professor Mahmadu Jega posed a poser: ‘with the mountain of problems facing Nigeria, why do we have dozens of people coming out to vie for the post of President? The answer is GREED! My hunch is that each of the candidates and their supporters have a cleaver inside their pocket with which to cut their own share of Nigeria’s dying whale. Make Abraham Lincoln the President, Winston Churchill, VP, Lee Kuan Yew the Finance Minister and Barack Obama the Chief of Staff to the President, forging elite consensus in any of those 3 republics (SAIII, PIBI and Nigeria) is not just a Herculean task, but it is an impossibility. *And no elite consensus, no transformation, no life after 70*! The Sokoto Jungle Justice of 10th May 2022 provides a litmus test for all the Presidential aspirants. Any aspirant who cannot take a public stand on the constitutionality of jungle justice is not a fit and proper person to lead Nigeria. *Madness N0 6:*Pleasure without Productivity, Gains without Pains, Platinum lifestyle without Perspiration.The country which received the lousy trophy of the world’s poverty capital in 2019 and has the world’s highest number of out of school children is also the country reputed to host the highest number of private jet owners in the world after America and China and one of the biggest Champagne consuming nations. *The Country dies when the two most thriving sectors of the economy are Politics and YAHOO+*! *Madness N07:*Nigeria, a Kidnapped State in Chains. Nigeria’s situation is worse than what Political Economists call ‘’State Capture’. On May 24 1966, through Decree 34 promulgated by the then Military Administration of General Aguiyi Ironsi, the ‘’FIRST NIGERIA’’ was kidnapped and chained down. Liberating a captured state is far easier than a kidnapped one with manacles on her legs and shackles on her arms. For instance, despite the Mafia’s notoriety, Mexico remains the world’s 15th strongest economy in the world. Ironsi got it all wrong when he concluded that “All Nigerians want an end to regionalism, tribal loyalties, and activities which promote tribal consciousness and sectional interest…’’ The then Military Governor of the Northern Region, Gen Hassan Usman Katsina and Gen David Ejoor of the Mid-Western Region expressed strong reservation and opined that it would lead to future complications. Lt Col Ojukwu and Dr Nnamdi Azikwe celebrated the unification Decree. General Ironsi tapped his kinsman, Mr Nwokedi of the Civil Service to produce a white paper for the establishment of the ‘’Administrative machinery for the unification decree’’. Gen Adekunle Fajuyi of the Western Region maintained neutrality.The rain began to beat Nigeria in 1966 when the Military thought it could decree against tribal consciousness – something which Europeans fought a 100-years war on. Unarguably, the relative peace which Europe has enjoyed in the last 80 years is due to the ethnic re-alignments in Europe since the end of WW2.Some Nigerians ignorantly still believe that all Nigeria needs is a strong leader. Josip Tito was a strong leader of Yugoslavia, yet the country pulled apart along ethnic lines after his death. We lie when we say ethnic groupings are anachronistic. They are not.The only thing missing in Nigeria’s unenviable history is not to have been governed by someone who died and rose up or an ALIEN from Jupiter! We have tried a Technocrat (Shonekan); Benevolent Dictator ( IBB); Kill & Go General (Abacha- Kanuri); Academician & Ijaw ( Jonathan, PhD); Poor Teacher (Balewa); ‘Praying when looting is going on’ President (Shaghari);  Yoruba &Engineer ( OBJ 1&2);  Meyitti Allah ideologue & Fulani hero (Buhari 1&2); the Socialist & a Good man (Yar Adua); Youth &Middle Belt (Gowon); Practising Muslim (Abdusalam); Hausa &Revolutionist (Muritala);  Igbo (Ironsi, Zik) as Presidents. We have tried an orphan (IBB) and Mr Integrity (PMB) and what do they all have in common? Similar results ranging from P7, P8 & F9. Nigeria has failed to become a nation but instead she remains an economic dwarf in the comity of nations despite the gargantuan natural and human resources she is blessed with. Who among the current gladiators has a better profile and preparation than OBJ of 1999? The whole world saw in OBJ a second Mandela but OBJ could not “Mandelarize”  This tells you that Nigeria's ailments do not respond to ""strong leader"" treatment. Which Team shall we send to retrieve and unchain Nigeria from the kidnappers’ Den, then?  We cannot count on Buhari’s successor for a successful rescue mission. There seems to be a thing that makes the ‘Aso Rock General Overseer’ become clueless, ball-less and goal-less, no sooner than he is sworn in. Whatever it takes, I insist, we must preserve Nigeria as an entity. Without Nigeria, the hope of transforming Africa and the entire black race will remain a will-o-the-wisp. *Soft Landing Pathways*A regional form of governance, anchored on the 1963 constitution with a modicum modification (insertion of Referendum clause: Dr Azikwe was wrong to have opposed the referendum clause in the 1960s) is the most suitable for a multi-ethnic, multi-religious country like Nigeria, where every Region has power to prioritize her developmental agenda and pay 30% tax to the Center in Abuja for security, passport and currency Management.*How*? Nigeria is lucky that some members of the Military cabal who witnessed the kidnapping exercise and who know where Nigeria is chained are still alive. Yugoslavia lacked this. When President Josip Tito and a dozen of strong Personalities who stabilized Yugoslavia passed away, the country passed away with them. There was no one with the institutional memory and voice to call the boys to order when Mr Devil paid them a courtesy visit. Nigerians should appeal to the *Owners of Nigeria* to untie it before they go the way of all flesh. To this end, I recommend the immediate setting up of *NIGERIA RE-WORK EMINENT PERSONALITIES TEAM* *NREPT* whose Executive Secretary shall be Dr Father Matthew Kukah, and Chairman, Chief Olusegun Obsanjo and Co-Chairman, The Sultan of Sokoto. Other recommended members are IBB, TY.Danjuma, Gowon, Abdusalam, Pastor EA Adeboye, plus 12 opinion leaders, two from each geo political Zone ( G8+12).Strange illnesses require strange medication. The main task of NREPT is to get the National Assembly to meet and invoke the DOCTRINE OF NECESSITY ON RE-WORK NIGERIA. This will empower the National Assembly to circumvent the laborious legal complications that have been militating against restructuring since 1993. In a word, *NREPT* should help us rescue Nigeria from the Kidnappers’ den, help us unchain it and drop her at the 1963 Roundabout from where she was kidnapped. Every Region will get her best Surgeons to stabilize her portion of Nigeria and make it work. We need at least 50 years to experiment with the Regional government, in the first instance. By my rough projection, if Nigeria takes this bypass, within the next decade, Nigeria’s GDP will increase from $400 Billion to about $4.4 Trillion, which will be like adding the GDPs of South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Israel, UAE, Qatar and Malaysia together. The manufacturing Western Region becomes South Korea at $1.8 Trillion, the mineral resource-rich Core North becomes a combination of UAE+ Malaysia- $800 Billion, Middle Belt, the Food Basket is Thailand at $500 Billion, and the innovative East is Taiwan at $700 Billion and the oil and gas rich Mid- West is Qatar+ Israel at $700 Billion.Show me someone who votes down the above option and I will show you a rapaciously greedy, lazy man.In conclusion, I will exit with the following five thoughts for the elites to ponder on, before I handover the microphone to Nigerians to ‘kontinu’ the conversation. One, Nature does not allow a situation to be mismanaged for long. President Mubarak and the then Egyptian ruling elites realised this truism too late. They were humiliated out of power and all died unsung. The 70 million ’sleeping’ Nigerians who survive on $ 1.00 per day are like time bombs waiting to explode. Two, there is no equilibrium in greed. The Yugoslavia ruling elites, trumpeting the indivisibility of their country just like their Nigeria counterparts, were busy having fun inside the locked room, with A/Cs and sound stereos on, Champagne in one hand, steak in the other; women of easy virtues rubbing their heads, and alas, they forgot to lock the ""kitchen door"" from where the army of angry, hungry and frustrated Yugoslavians entered the room and detonated the bomb which sent most of the elites to the Great Beyond as they  ran out of time to activate their PLAN B. The second passport was useless.Three, there is no equilibrium in poverty, nothing says Nigeria cannot go further downhill, if we ‘kontinu’ with this TikTok democracy without corresponding dividends. Four, Nature abhors a vacuum. A Nation’s tree that does not bear fruits after 70 years may ‘’fall down and die’’. Five and finally, Nigeria’s Ship has since passed the Tokenism harbour, nothing short of a complete remodeling will save the Ship from capsizing.Homework: What lessons can the Nigerian Elites learn from the Yugoslavia experience and what do they understand by Collective Enlightened self Interest (CESI)?

167,"Alleged drug pusher and disgraced police officer Abba Kyari says he is being forced to bankroll the DSTV subscription bills for his fellow inmates at Kuje prison as he cools off his feet in a private cell, Peoples Gazette has learnt.  Nureini Jimoh, Mr Kyari’s lawyer who filed for a review of his client’s bail application, lamented the harsh treatment his client suffered at the prison.Through his lawyer, Mr Kyari bewailed his incarceration at the correctional facility shared with other criminals, majority of whom were arrested by his team during his active years in service.According to the documents seen by The Gazette, the suspended officer had resorted to doling out cash gifts to inmates and paying cable television bills to avoid being attacked and killed by the vicious criminals he helped put behind bars. “In a bid to mitigate the threats to kill the defendants/applicants, the chief warder advised DCP Abba Kyari and other defendants to advance some goodwill to the inmates by funding renewal of the DSTV subscription in all the cells for two months and make some cash donations to all the inmates group leaders as well as the church and mosque. The defendants/applicants complied on 29/03/2022,” stated the document.Mr Kyari’s brother Mohammed swore an affidavit that contained details of the disgraced police officer’s argument.Praying the Abuja Division of the Federal High Court to review his bail application, the alleged drug dealer claimed his life was not safe as he had been accosted by a Boko Haram terrorist “Yasir,” on March 31, despite being held in a private cell. Mr Kyari further expressed worry over the increasing number of threats from fellow inmates comprising terrorists and armed robbers he once arrested in the course of duty.“The number of inmates in prison at the distance of the IRT is large, but most worrisome are those arrested for terrorism, vowing to revenge the killing of their members who died in the course of operations by the DCP Abba Kyari led IRT,” Mr Jimoh pointed out. “The resultant effect of placing the applicants together with the condemned criminals in the same custodial home will have negative impacts on police and other security personnel, the likelihood of endangering and exposing the life of the officers to criminals in and out of service.”Mr Kyari’s previous request for bail application to the court was initially rejected.Citing instances of insecurity such as the Kaduna-Abuja train bombing on March 28, the Kaduna airport attack, as well as rampant banditry on the road linking Kaduna to Abuja, Mr Kyari argued that Nigeria had become a hotbed of crises ever since his arrest.https://gazettengr.com/im-kept-in-kuje-prison-private-cell-forced-to-pay-dstv-bills-for-my-fellow-inmates-abba-kyari/?fbclid=IwAR0hO6aBEUAiTPVkV8z2y_qxFI7ScsOEQdhgElnib1d3lH2rMlSi4XoUfJICc;mynd44","Kyari; In Kuje Prison Private Cell, I was Forced to Pay DSTV..."

They are motorcycle riders and have dangerous weapons stocked under the seat of their motorcycles,” he said.The SSSG publicity secretary added that the reopening of Seme Border had, rather than being a blessing, turned out to be a curse, saying: “Our attention has been drawn to the various activities playing out at the Seme border. They didn’t allow duties, but they allow non-Nigerians from Burkina-Faso and Mali to find their way illegally to Iwoye, a town in Ogun State that shares border with Benin Republic.”The group, therefore, urged all the South-West governors, traditional rulers and other stakeholders across the region to brace up to the security challenges to make the region safe.https://guardian.ng/news/group-raises-the-alarm-over-influx-of-non-nigerians-into-swest/?utm_term=Autofeed&echobox=twitter_post&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1652419678Mynd44 Lalasticlala OAM4J","Yoruba Group Warns About Influx Of Fulanis From Mali, Chad, Niger Into SW"

Governor Soludo truly has a burning desire to bring peace and security in Anambra State. His visit to Nnamdi Kanu at DSS custody is not something that can be taken for granted. It's something that must be appreciated by ndi Anambra and igbo's at large. My reason for saying this is because Governor Soludo is a character that means business. He is not someone that fakes it. If he wants to achieve a goal, he will ensure that no stone will be left unturned to achieve that goal. I was so happy to see Governor Soludo pics with Nnamdi Kanu that is in DSS custody. It shows that he feels Nnamdi Kanu pain and that he is deeply touched with the insecurity in Anambra and Southeast at large. I can say it boldly that with Governor Soludo visit to Nnamdi Kanu at DSS custody that he has two things in mind and they are (1)The release of Nnamdi Kanu from detention(2)putting an end to the insecurity in Anambra and Southeast at large. The two things Governor Soludo has in mind that made him  to visit Nnamdi Kanu has shown that he has the interest of ndi Anambra and igbo's at large in his heart. Let's not forget in a hurry that no other Southeast Governor was bold enough to identify with Nnamdi Kanu in this period of his incarceration at DSS custody but Governor Soludo has done that. He deserves to be commended and appreciated for making that bold move. Am proud of my support for Governor Soludo and I know that other of his supporters are proud of their support for him. He has truly justified the confidence reposed on him by Anambra electorates. Deep down in my heart, I see Governor Soludo as the only Presidential material igbo's can boast of having but let the will of God be done.","Soludo visits Nnamdi Kanu in DSS custody, Obigwe hails move"

On the date of the protest, armed men would be deployed to takeover the venue and even make illegal arrests or even kill protesters.It had always been the case with IPOB before they went rogue.It was the case with those who gathered at Ojota to protest the arrest of Sunday Igboho.What happened during EndSARS is common knowledge.It was repeated when youths wanted to commemorate the one year anniversary of the EndSARS protest.But not so in the North. These retards were allowed to have a field day and destroy businesses without hindrance.And you think the youths that are watching are not taking notes?The truth is that this Lugardian Experiment was a mistake, has always been a mistake and will never work.As much one tries not to subscribe to the many postulations of Nnamdi Kanu, daily happenings in this country can’t help but force you to become his disciple.North and south have no business together.

In a viral video obtained by SaharaReporters, the preacher said, ""He wrote on Facebook. He said a lot of things that are not right about the prophet of Allah and in Sokoto, I said he was courageous. For us, we kill such a person. For the prophet of Allah, the least we can do is to kill. ""We are not like Muslims, because Kano Muslims are more like merchants.

194,"Ndi Igbo. We know how to jinx a good thing. Perhaps, it is our seeming indomitability, boisterousness and Thanos-will that seduce us to think everyone must believe in what we believe in and must act and think in consonance with our disposition. Anyone who does not support us or share in our sentiments is an enemy deserving the guillotine. How did we evolve illiberally?We were not always this philistine, intolerant, angry, minatory and hateful. Our fathers were peaceful people who lived through a brutal war, yet held out a hand of brotherhood to other Nigerians. Some have lived and died in the north and in other parts of Nigeria outside the south-east since the civil war. They were accommodating of divergent views, temperate in utterance, graceful and measured in actions.The Igbo young today, particularly those who take up residence on social media, are quick-tempered, oafish and ready to maul anyone who holds a plural view. They are unthinking, rash and uncritical. It must be their way or the highway to hell. What a retrogressive evolutionary trajectory! How did a critical mass of the Igbo young become so narrow-minded and uncultivated?Maybe these ones do not know that to be Igbo is to be liberal; it is to be egalitarian; it is to be expansive; it is to be accommodating of all views and people; it is to be critical and circumspect, questioning everything and believing nothing until there is proof. And most importantly, to be Igbo is to not deify any earthling or make any human a god.Since Peter Obi, former Anambra governor, declared his intention to run for president, a horde of internet contagion has been attacking anyone who does not show support for him. His supporters have been the most intemperate. Wielding virtual cudgels, they bludgeon anyone who refuses to acknowledge Peter Obi as a better presidential candidate. They empty their bowels of invective, hate and threats against anyone who points out the obvious political weaknesses of the former Anambra governor.Peter Obi’s political network is abysmally limited. As I have always said, he is the creation of an internet fad and does not matter to the hoi polloi. But he is a decent man with the potential of a progressive president. If only wishes were horses, Peter Obi would ride them to the presidency. Sadly, they are not.Only Igbo votes cannot make Peter Obi president. He needs first the votes of PDP delegates from across the states. And if by some twist of kismet, he becomes the PDP presidential candidate, he needs the votes of all Nigerians, particularly the north. His supporters are perhaps too self-absorbed or utterly ignorant to understand that belching ethnic slurs against other Nigerians on the internet because they are not so taken in by him is actually demarketing his candidature.This is not how to win popular support in a country like Nigeria with a very diverse population. Instead of pulling moderates and the undecided to the umbrella of Peter Obi, his supporters are setting them apart and even turning the minds of those who are sympathetic to Obi’s candidature.Who would want a Peter Obi presidency where his supporters are rabid, caustic, bigoted and hateful? It is becoming obvious that some of Peter Obi’s supporters may be from the same gene-pool as those who promoted south-east secession. It is the same non-strategy – hate, anger and more hate.Peter Obi’s supporters may think they are aggressively promoting him, but they have only succeeded in reducing him to an ethnic champion. How unpropitious that a good product should be so jinxed.It appears the south-east is in dire need of a messiah; so, any person that fate throws up is summarily crowned as a lodestar to lead the Igbo out of eight years of wandering. But we must realise that we are the messiah we seek. It is our collective action that matters.Peter Obi is a gentleman, peace-loving, soft-spoken, refined, expansive and cerebral. I know he will not support the hate his supporters trade on social media. In fact, what his supporters do is antithetical to what he stands for. I think it is wise he addresses the mobilisers of his campaign on social media to put some decorum and decency to their crusade for him. He needs Nigerians to be president.By Fredrick Nwabufo; Nwabufo aka Mr OneNigeria is a writer and journalist.https://www.thecable.ng/peter-obis-supporters-are-demarketing-him/amp?fbclid=IwAR1CkHxqiCsvdKf9t3DqFfILbSNwzrKSEU02pHrs4MDmiLPoOTrEUeuzWBA",''Peter Obi’s Supporters Are Demarketing Him'' by Fredrick Nwabufo

He was also seen in several viral pictures holding aloft fruits, which is the symbol of the NNPP.The NNPP has been raking in a lot of decampees from other parties in the state, notably the APC and the PDP.

So, I said it should be taken down and that every tweet must have my express approval.”Samuel, a second-year student of the Shehu Shagari College of Education in Sokoto State, was killed on Thursday following an allegation that she had blasphemed Muhammad (SAW), the prophet of Islam.Her death sparked an outrage from various individuals and groups, including the Christian community who demanded that her killers be brought to justice.A tweet on Thursday night from the former vice president’s verified handle also triggered unpleasant reactions from users from the northern part of the country before it was deleted.While Atiku insisted that the tweet was not deleted over fears that the negative reactions could affect his political aspiration, he said the only thing that went wrong was because he was not consented.“I am not a person who is afraid to take stand on issues; you know the stand I took on Sharia. I was pelted, I was abused in the North, but then how long did the Sharia last?” he quired. “I told them they were having a political Sharia and I was vilified, they threw stones at me.“There was nothing they did not do; that did not make me change my position as far as Sharia is concerned. Where is the Sharia today?

They said that they shouldn’t bury the body as the body is for the government and not for the family.

206,"Please this piece Wes copied from a group post and is an appeal for calmness on the murder of Deborah Samuel and to also point out that Islam has order on issue of blasphemy .The gruesome murder of Deborah YakubuThis is exactly what happened to Abdullar Alhaji Umaru on the 14th day of July 1999.Here is the gist of what happened in that case as decided by the Supreme Court in SHALLA v. STATE (2007) LPELR-3034(SC).One man called Abubakar Dan Shalla and five of his friends heard that Abdullar insulted the Prophet (SAW). According to Shalla, he told the police what happened as follows:""On Wednesday 14/7/99 at about 2000hrs afterIsha'I prayers, I sat down at the frontage of Mosque at Faransi Area of Kardi then one Musa Yaro of Kardi came and met me with an information that, someone abused Prophet Mohammed at Randali Village which he is not sure, but he will try to find out at Randali.On hearing that, I stood up and went inside my house and carried knife along with me, and I moved to Randali. On reaching there, I went straight to one Shugaban Samari for confirmation about the abusing of Prophet Mohammed and he assured me that, the issue is true, and that there were witnesses to testify but he did not tell me the kind of abuse. And from there, I heard someone saying, that Abdullahi Alh Umaru who abused the Prophet had been arrested at Kardi, then I quickly went back and met Abdullahi.As they returned back from the Village Head's house, Musa Yaro made some quotation in*Risalah* which means that whoever abused Prophet Mohammed shall be killed, then people started beating Abdullahi Alh. Umaru, and Mohammed Sanibmatcheted him and he fell down, then I removed the knife that was in my possession with my right hand and slaughtered him ""deceased"" just along Randali-Kardi Road near a burial ground of Kardi. And we all dispersed.""Shalla and his five friends were charged for murder or culpable homicide before the trial Judge, Ambursa, J. on 24-02-2000 of the Kebbi State High Court.They were found guilty of murder and sentenced to die by hanging. They appeal to Court of Appeal and failed. The further appealed to Supreme Court. Here is an interesting pronouncement by My Lord the Justice I. T. Mahmud JSC who is now the Chief Justice of Nigeria. He said:""Islamic religion is not a primitive religion that allows its adherents to take the law into their own hands and to commit jungle justice. Instead, there is a judicial system in Islam which hears and determines cases including the trial of criminal offences and any body accused of committing an offence against the religion or against a fellow Muslim brother should be taken to the court (either a Sharia or a secular/common law court) for adjudication. It is only when a person is convicted and sentenced by a court of law that he will be liable to a punishment which will be carried out by an appropriate authority (i.e. the prison)""He further stated that:Although it is true that there is the provision in*Risala* which prescribes the punishment of death on *any Muslim* who insults the Holy Prophet such punishment can only be imposed by the appropriate authority (i.e. the court) rather than by any member of the society whether a Muslim or otherwise.The relevant provision can be quoted from ""Risala (treatise on Maliki law)"" translated andannotated by Joseph Kenny - Chapter 37 atparagraph 37.19 page 173 as follows- 'If someone speaks disrespectfully of the Messenger of God (sabb-an-nabiy) he should be put to death without accepting his repentance.'The chapter begins with the following passagewhich is instructive-'37.01 No one may be put to death for homicideunless he is convicted by -(1) adequate testimony (bayyinat) or(2) his own admission (lgrar), or(3) as sworn indictment (qasama) If that is necessary ... '  (italics and brackets suppliedfor emphasis)It is also pertinent to note that the next immediatechapter following chapter 37 (i.e. chapter 38) inthe Risala provides for ""judgment"" Procedure and Access."" In this subsequent chapter, it is made very clear that decisions on cases including criminalcases are the function of Judges who observe the court procedure and whose actions or decisions arebased on testimony or evidence (bayyina)admission (Iqrar) or oath (Yamin) - seeAththamarud Dani (Commentary on Risala) pages 604-707...All my above explanation of the rule in Risala relied upon by the appellants in their action show that it is the Judge (who is qualified to adjudicate) or the court of law whose responsibility is to apply the judgement.He further stated that the Accused persons ""were merely a bunch of blood thirsty and militant or religious fundamentalists who were all out to satisfy their vindictive zeal against the deceased.""He concluded that ""In my view, it is the appellants rather than the deceased who committed an offence against Islamic or Sharia by their unjustified action which represents to the public that Sharia is an uncivilized and primitive system which allows or permits the killing of people without complying with the due process of law.""On the above view, Shalla and his friends that killed Abdullar on allegation of insulting the Holy Prophet were sentenced to die by the Supreme Court.  Each of them narrated fully the role he played. The 3rd accused admitted striking the deceased with a matchet on the neck, the 5th accused admitted slaughtering the deceased with a knife, the 6th accused admitted holding and pulling the deceased to the last destination, the 1st accused admitted giving the authority to kill the deceased while the 2nd and 4th accused admitted going up and down to ensure that the deceased was punished. They were all sentenced to dead.This should be the fate of all those who actively or passively support the murder of Deborah Yakubu in Sokoto in line with the above decision of the Supreme Court.- Pius Danba",Deborah Samuel: Justice She Will Get
207,"Abdulmumin Jibrin, Director-General of the Bola Tinubu Support Group, says he left the All Progressives Congress (APC) “to take the needed measure to ensure that I survive an onslaught by a vengeful man who abuses the privileges of his distinguished office to frustrate my career and the career of many others”.He also said he would no longer be involved with the presidential campaign of Tinubu because he has moved to the New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP).In a statement he shared exclusively with TheCable, the former member of the houses of reps said even away from home, “the vengeful man” came for his role in Asiwaju’s campaign and pressed hard to replace him.“Asiwaju (Bola Tinubu) did his best to intervene to prevent my exit from the party. Not because it would affect his campaign in any way but for the genuine likeness he has for me. Unfortunately, wherever this man after my career functions, I feel a sense of obligation to flee for my political safety,"" he said.Although he did not name the “vengeful man”, there are strong suggestions that he was referring to Abdullahi Ganduje, the governor of Kano state.THE FULL TEXTIn the past nine years, I devoted my material, intellectual and political resources to propel the cause of the All Progressives Congress. As Chairman of the House Committee on Finance in the last quarter of 2013, when the alliances that would become the APC materialized, I took a huge risk to join other compatriots in leading 60 members of the House of Representatives from the People’s Democratic Party to the APC. I provided the seed money for logistics and venue for our meetings, and this aided our internal revolt to weaken the then ruling party and a government fiercely threatened by the prospects of the new party we set out to market to the good people of Nigeria a benign alternative. I became a subject of intense threats and personality attacks from a vindictive government that deployed the resources of the state to hound me as a high-ranking committee Chairman from the fast-growing party.In 2015, I emerged as Chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations and, in line with the cardinal principles of the new APC government, I launched an ambitious reform of the appropriation process. While the APC supported and encouraged me at the initial stage, that support fizzled out when I needed it the most. I lost two years of my term in suspension and, by the time I returned to the House, the presiding officers were already at ‘war’ with the party and the executive arm of government. The party and government needed help again.The APC government needed a strong support base and platform to withstand the gathering aggression from the National Assembly. That threat inspired the formation of the Pro-Buhari Parliamentary Support Group to protect the interests of the party in the legislature. While the activities of the group took off in the Senate and led by the current APC National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, it could not in the House. When I returned to the House in 2018, I convened and led the Parliamentary Support Group amidst several caveats to desist from doing so and threats of suspension again. I stood my ground and engineered a working relationship with our counterparts at the Senate to build an infrangible support base in NASS for the APC-led government ahead of the 2019 general elections.When I won an election for the third term to the House in 2019, I felt it was time to take on a new responsibility, and I intended to run for the position of the Speaker or the Deputy. The party prevailed on me to shelve my ambition in the interest of zoning. I did and accepted to lead the campaign of the current Speaker. We worked day and night and defied crude antagonism and sabotage to guarantee APC’s chances of securing the Speakership position. In the end, we all paid our dues to a party that isn’t only refusing to acknowledge the sacrifices of its frontline foot-soldiers, but quick to throw them under the bus.Before I was appointed Executive Director at Federal Housing Authority, I had lost my seat through a questionable court judgement, especially in the subsequent by-election where the whole world witnessed the interferences that cost me the seat with some leaders of the APC involved. Though my new role was an appointment much lower than my previous positions, I accepted it in a good faith, believing it’s another avenue to serve my fatherland. I found myself inundated by too many conflicting reforms and policies at the FHA, I began to lose appetite for the job. In the whole of these, the APC left me in the wilderness.In my twenty-three years of postgraduate experience, the last seven years were my most unremarkable, so much that my long-established career almost reached a point of utter implosion. The sixteen years before then were driven by prosperity and accelerated growth for which I’m grateful to the Almighty Allah and the amazing people in my circle. In those pleasant years, I was at peace with myself and my career. I was focused and felt appreciated. I enjoyed quality mentorship, love, and support from some of the nation’s great minds who are still active in our politics. They can attest to my character, loyalty, selflessness, and commitment to whichever cause I took part in. It must be underlined, though, that I was financially stable before joining politics and have always been a financial contributor to all the political groups and activities I have been involved.The horrifying disappointments of my past seven years revolved around this character who’s determined to destroy anybody that activates his glaring inferiority complex. His sadistic instincts make him quite a frightening ally, so much that he feels the need to treat his allies as the marginalized black Africans in apartheid-era South Africans to feel a sense of superiority and misguided advantage. I dedicated everything to the political interests of this man, but he kept asking for more. This circus became too embarrassing that I had to take a step back for soul-searching to redeem myself. There’s a difference between service for the common good and a quest to be worshipped by one’s allies. We must never confuse loyalty with slavery.I have a family, state, and country to live for, and I cannot give my life to him. This is one impossible sacrifice. But this man yearned for that and put me through a mentally draining phase in my life that I had to step aside to reflect on my political choices. It’s unsurprising that all his political principals and lieutenants are deserting him, and he risks becoming an island at the end of his stewardship. When he tried to lure me back a few days ago in a lengthy phone conversation, I asked him a question to stir up deep introspection on his demoralizing interpersonal relations. I asked if, as a father, he would want others to treat his children in the fashion he treats us his political allies and lieutenants. At the appropriate time, I intend to discuss the viciousness of this man in detail.Indeed, I love the APC, and I fought for it to the best of my capability. I’m going to miss the party, no doubt, but my survival is vital at this point in my political life. I have built lasting friendships in the party, some of whom are leaders I will hold dearly for the rest of my life, including President Muhammadu Buhari to whom I’ve enjoyed a rare privilege of access whenever I requested to meet him. I shall remain his son even after 2023. I thank everyone for their support and kindness.However, my exit from the APC means I’ve ceased to be involved in the presidential campaign of Alhaji Bola Ahmed Tinubu. The fact is, no individual can be a significant minus in Asiwaju’s campaign. The campaign is armor-built and designed to excel even without me. Based on the passion and dedication of the team invested in his aspiration, not even Asiwaju can stop his campaign let alone an Abdulmumin Jibrin. I want to appeal to the public to avoid overestimating my relevance to the team and stop the rumour and creating all sort of theories around this matter. I have my value but it will not take away anything from the menu I saw on the BAT campaign table. For the avoidance of doubt, let me clarify that I have no problem whatsoever with Asiwaju. We have never for once had issues. My problems were local and all politics are local. Asiwaju took a sincere interest in me and gave me the free hands to participate in his project, and my exit from the party doesn’t erase my respect for him and belief in his capacity and vision to redeem the fortunes of Nigeria.But there has to be a Jibrin first before a Jibrin works for anyone. I have to take the needed measure to ensure that I survive an onslaught by a vengeful man who abuses the privileges of his distinguished office to frustrate my career and the career of many others. Obsessed with my political prospects even away from home, he came for my role in Asiwaju’s campaign and pressed hard to replace me. Asiwaju did his best to intervene to prevent my exit from the party. Not because it would affect his campaign in any way but for the genuine likeness he has for me. Unfortunately, wherever this man after my career functions, I feel a sense of obligation to flee for my political safety. It’s one toxicity I’m no longer prepared to endure, and I do want to use this opportunity to apologize to the entire BAT family across the country for whatever embarrassment or inconvenience my sudden exit from the APC must’ve caused. I have already met Asiwaju to tender my apology, and he will continue to be a father to me and his house, my home.Let me also use this opportunity to inform the public that I have joined the New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP) under the leadership of Engr Dr Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso to continue the pursuit of peace and progress in serving our dear Kano state and the entire nation. This is another avenue to serve the people and participate in delivering quality governance and development across the nation, and I’m most grateful for the warm reception and exciting prospects ahead.Thank you.https://www.thecable.ng/exclusive-why-i-left-apc-abdulmumin-jibrin-opens-up-on-his-defection-to-nnpp/amp",‘why I Left APC’ — Abdulmumin Jibrin Opens Up On His Defection To NNPP

It also applies to the learned, especially members of the ʿulamāʾ (theologian) class, and to anyone who has memorized the entire Qur’an, no matter how young.Shaykh al-jabal (“Chief of the Hill”) was a popular name for the Assassin leader, mistranslated by the Crusaders as “Old Man of the Hill”.

214,"President Major General Muhammadu Buhari was very reluctant to sign the Electoral Act Ammendment Bill 2022 into law because of the obnoxious Section 84 (12), which states that,        “ No political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.”During the ceremony held on Friday 25th February, 2022, the President insisted on a commitment by the legislators that the  offending Section would be expunged from the Act and returned to him for a fresh approval but the promise is yet to be fulfilled.However in a turn of events which jolted Federal political appointees to their feet at the Federal Executive Council (FEC), meeting on Wednesday 11th May 2022, Minister of Information disclosed that the President had directed that all ministers, legislators, special advisers willing to run for elective offices should submit their letters of resignation on or before Monday the 16th of May 2022.The information minister stressed that the mandate excluded the vice president because he is an elected member of the cabinet.

Those aggrieved by the student’s post should have reported her to the security agencies or to the Shariah police, the hisbah. Mob killing is archaic and bohemian. It belongs to the Stone Age. Nobody has the right to take the law into his hands.” the statement reads.“The Glorious Qur’an compares the killing of a single person to the killing of the whole of humanity just as it compares the saving of a life to the rescue of all homo sapiens (Qur’an 5:32) In like manner, Prophet Muhammad (SAW) himself condemned all acts of violence and advocated peaceful conduct at all times.“But this incident should not be condemned in isolation. The recent trend whereby Nigerians now freely shed their brothers blood should be condemned by all patriots. In this regard, we also strongly denounce the killing of several northern Muslims in the south-east in the past few months.“We frown at the recent burning last week of a truck fully loaded with cows in the south-east as well as the killing of many Muslims of south-east origin by their Igbo brothers in the same south-east. We note with keen interest that Muslims in the morth did not retaliate when these killings were taking place.“MURIC calls on the Sokoto police command to do everything within its power to get to the bottom of yesterday’s killing of the female student over alleged blasphemy.“We appeal to members of the public to remain calm and law abiding.

I am carefully choosing my words as an umpire because I am holding a very sensitive position as deputy chairman of one of the electoral committees.""Diri, who described Atiku as one of the strong contenders for the party’s presidential ticket, noted that the PDP was more interested in wresting political power from what he described as “the rudderless, directionless and failed government of the All Progressives Congress.""Speaking earlier, Atiku stressed that the PDP must put its best candidate forward in order to wrest power back from the APC.The former vice president called on the party to brace up and be united for the sake of Nigeria, emphasising that the PDP could not afford to be in the opposition again from 2023.Atiku said, “We must put our best forward. Meaning who we believe can bring us back to power. It is very important. We must brace up as a political party. We must unite to return our political party back to power. We cannot afford to be in opposition again.“There must be peace and unity before this country can be governed. That is why I emphasise unity and the need to unify the country. What I mean is that; I am going to give every part, every section, religion and faith, a sense of belonging in this country.”https://saharareporters.com/2022/05/13/2023-power-should-rotate-southern-nigeria-%E2%80%93-bayelsa-governor-tells-visiting-ex-vice",2023: Power Should Rotate To Southern Nigeria – Douye Diri Tells Atiku

We want these miscreants to know that nobody has the monopoly of violence, they should stop or else, they will see us soon.“The same way Igbos are living in Sokoto doing their legitimate business is also the same way Sokoto indigenes are living in the South doing their business”.The coalition called on the Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal to immediately arrest and prosecute those involved in the destruction of Igbo properties and churches.https://dailypost.ng/2022/05/14/sokoto-riot-you-will-soon-see-us-southeast-youths-fume-over-attacks-on-igbos-shops-churches/","Sokoto Riot: You Will Soon See Us – Southeast Youths Fume Over Attacks On Igbos,"

May the recklessness of our tongues never drive us to (an) early grave.” Ms Samuel, a 200 level Home-Economics student accused of blasphemy, had complained bitterly over the influx of religious broadcast messages shared to her department’s WhatsApp page.Her complaints elicited the fury of fanatic coursemates and schoolmates who stoned her to death and set her lifeless body ablaze.https://gazettengr.com/deborah-samuel-crossed-islamic-red-line-dont-blame-her-killers-imam-of-national-mosque-abuja/?fbclid=IwAR38qytwnL-xj1I00DINbVbgnGqJfCUnoBkYKZ5lqc7ALg5LW2OO5SfTX4Y#l34dx2ddhafz2izv5h8",Deborah Samuel Crossed Islamic Red Line; Don't Blame Her Killers: Imam
228,"By Esther DanielsA top contender for the Ado/Okpokwu/Ogbadibo Federal Constituency seat in Benue State on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Phillip Agbese, has narrated how he miraculously survived a ghastly motor accident. The human rights activist was involved in an auto crash on his way to Otukpo after concluding his local government declaration tour in Ogbadibo, on April 10th. Speaking for the first time after a month, Agbese said God preserved his life so that he could serve Him more devotedly and touch more lives through philanthropy.  According to him, the accident was the handiwork of his political detractors who wanted him out of the way at all cost. Speaking to newsmen on Saturday in Abuja, the UK-trained lawyer revealed that founder of Dunamis International Gospel Centre, Pastor Paul Enenche appeared to him and rescued him from the incident.  He added that the renowned preacher handed him a Bible and a bag containing numerous gift items. He further revealed that Enenche directed him to use the holy book to spread the good news of Jesus and use the goody bag to reach out to more less privileged people in the nation. “My life is a testimony. I’m alive by the divine intervention of the Lord,” Agbese said. “It was all planned out by my political opponents to eliminate me. I’m speaking to you by the mercies of God”, he added.Quoting from the book of Isaiah 59:19, he said “When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against them. This is exactly my story.“I am God’s Minister. God revealed to me that those behind the accident will live to regret it and that I should forgive them. But I love them all and I have forgiven them. “Nonetheless, I want to appeal to them to change their evil ways and come to Jesus. He is the way, the truth and life.“Like the disciples, I received the great commission to spread the gospel and touch more lives. These I will do as I continue my quest to bring quality representation to my people”.Despite this setback, Agbese, however, said he is assured of victory at the APC’s primary, noting that he could not serve God and end up in disappointment. The Okanga of Agila, as he is fondly called, through his campaign team, recently submitted his expression of interest and nomination forms at the International Conference Centre, Abuja.Agbese has pledged to equip the youths through education and ICT, while empowering the women in agribusiness","Reps Aspirant, Agbese Recounts How Pastor Enenche Rescued Him From Accident"

241,"The Sultan of Sokoto’s Palace was on Saturday under siege by the youth demanding the release of the alleged killers of Deborah Samuel. The student, Deborah Yakubu, was killed in a mob outrage, with the state government immediately closing down the school while police announced the arrest of two persons in connection with the incident.The protests were caused by an alleged religious blasphemy made by Deborah, a student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto, against the Islamic religion through a social media channel.A combined team of security men, led by State Police Commissioner, Mr Kamaludden Okunlola, was deployed to the palace while protesters threw stones and attempted to burn the palace. All the religious centres were also under tight security.Meanwhile, Gov. Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State on Saturday imposed 24 hours curfew to contain the rising protests across township streets over alleged religious blasphemy.Tambuwal, in a broadcast, called on the people to remain indoors as security operatives were being deployed to safeguard lives and properties.”By the powers conferred on me by sections 176(2) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and sections 1 and 4 of the Public Order Act; and, also Section 15 of Sokoto State Peace Preservation Law, I hereby declare, with immediate effect, a curfew within (Sokoto) metropolis for the next 24 hours,” Tambuwal declared.He further appealed to the people of the state to kindly continue to observe law and order and calm down the restiveness currently pervading the metropolis.”Everyone should please, in the interest of peace, go back home and observe these measures, to reestablish peace, law and order in the state.”It is not in the interest of anyone for us to have a breakdown of law and order. I, therefore, appeal for restraint and, for people to observe and respect the rule of law,” he said.A NAN correspondent, who went round the streets, reports that groups of youths have taken over the streets, chanting songs and urging security agents to release the arrested persons.The protesters burnt tyres on popular Ahmadu Bello Way, Emir Yahaya road, Kanwuri and other streets, forcing shop owners to close midday while most streets became empty.https://dailypost.ng/2022/05/14/deborah-samuel-muslim-youths-attack-sultans-palace-demand-release-of-students-killers/","Deborah Samuel: Muslim Youths Attack Sultan’s Palace, Demand Release Of Student’"

245,"Justice DC Maidoh of a Delta State High Court, Kwale Division has granted an order restraining the Board of Central Bank of Nigeria and Independent National Electoral Commission from stopping the CBN governor, Godwin Emiefele from seeking an elective post.The application was filed on May 5, 2022, and the judgement was granted on Thursday, May 12, SaharaReporters learnt.Armed with the court papers, Emefiele gleefully took them to President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday after which he stated that Nigerians will die of a heart attack.Reacting to his controversial presidential ambition which has seen many groups and notable Nigerians call for his resignation to preserve the sanctity of the treasury and national economy on Thursday, Emefiele boasted that he was having fun and cared less about what people had to say.He met with State House Correspondents after a closed-door meeting with President Buhari at the Presidential Villa in Abuja.Reacting to a report that the President had asked him to resign after the purchase of the presidential nomination and expression of interest forms of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Emefiele said, “There is no news now, but there will be news. You heard me, I said there is no news but there will be news.”But when told that Nigerians were anxious about his position, he said: “Let them have a heart attack. It’s good to have a heart attack. I am having a lot of fun.”SaharaReporters gathered that Emiefele had through a proxy, Augustine Eddiego approached the court asking, “An order restraining the defendants from treating the provision of section 9 of the Central Bank of Nigeria Act 2007 as amended as a bar on the Governor and Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria from seeking political offices pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice herein in this suit which borders on the interpretation and supremacy of the 1999 CFRN.”Section 9 of the CBN Act provides that “the Governor and the Deputy Governors shall devote the whole of their time to the service of the Bank and while holding office shall not engage in any full or part-time employment or vocation whether remunerated or not, except such personal or charitable causes as may be determined by the Board and which do not conflict with or detract from their full-time duties.”Justice Maidoh in a judgement secretly delivered on May 5 granted the order and adjourned the case to May 25.“In the circumstances, in line with order 39 rule 3 of our rules, this motion is hereby granted. The motion on notice is accordingly adjourned to 25/5/2022 for hearing,” the judge said.“The applicant is to enter an undertaking if the order sought ought not to have been made.”Court documents obtained by SaharaReporters say, “The court upon reading through the Motion papers and hearing C.N. Ofiah Esq. for the claimants/applicants ordered as follows: I have read the processes in this suit, the applicant has complied with order 39 of our rules.“Applicants also deposed to an affidavit of urgency. From the processes before this court, I find that the said application at this stage has merit pending the hearing and determination of the Motion on Notice. In the circumstances, in line with order 39 rule 3 of our rules, this motion is hereby granted. The motion on notice is accordingly adjourned to 25/5/2022 for hearing. The applicant is to enter undertaking if the order sought ought not to have been made.”Last week, a group of supporters said they had purchased the APC presidential form for the CBN boss.That move ended months of speculation that Emefiele was interested in Nigeria’s exalted position.Following the development, Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Femi Falana, argued Emefiele is not qualified to run for the office.He hinged his argument on the provisions of the Nigerian Constitution.Falana in a statement he issued on Monday, maintained that “while Mr. Emefiele is awaiting divine intervention it is pertinent to point out that by virtue of the combined effect of section 9 of the CBN Act and Section 18 of the Banks and Financial institutions Act 2020 it is the Board of the CBN that is competent to permit him to engage in politics or any other vocation.“So far, the Board of the CBN has not authorised him to participate in the primary election of the ruling party. To that extent, he is disqualified from seeking any elective position in the primary election of any political party or in the general election.”",2023: Emefiele Obtains Court Order Allowing Him Contest
246,"UNDER UZODIMMA, SOUTH EAST WILL NEVER GO INTO POLITICAL EXTINCTIONEvery well meaning Igbo man and woman, even children, are calling for and clamoring for a Nigerian President of Southeast extraction come 2023. This  is long overdue as the Southeast has continually supported other zones in the country with the same compensatory promise of handing over to an Igbo man yet all becomes rhetorics at the end.The agitation for a President of Southeast extraction became prominent due to the unity of all Igbos towards the goal and was made manifest by the influx of Igbo politicians expressing their interest to contest and a good number of them went ahead to purchase their various party's Presidential forms. I can tell you that the Igbos have not been more united in a project than this. Either we get it from APC or PDP but the goal is for an Igbo man to occupy Aso rock as Nigeria’s President.While it has become obvious and dawned on the Southeast that the hope of getting a Southeast President from the PDP may have become a pipe dream and a wishful thinking, APC had moved to zone the Presidential ticket to the South, but the reality is that our brothers from the Southwest and South South are ready to betray us again and I ask why??Must Tinubu, Osinbajo, Fayemi, Jonathan, Amaechi, Slyvia, Akpabio and their lots contest for Presidency? What happened to equity and equality? Did they forget that the Southwest has had their fair share with Olusegun Obasanjo as President for 8years and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo for close to 8years? Goodluck Jonathan had been Vice President and President for 8years? Or are they now suffer from selective amnesia? Of course, No!, they want to keep us politically irrelevant in Nigeria.We celebrated the Presidency of the Southwest extraction despite the marginalization of Ndi Igbo and even adopted the Presidency of the South South as our own even when it was obvious that the Northerners were kicking against it and now why can’t these our brothers rally round us and support our agitation? Why must they betray us now? Must they cut short our dreams? Indeed the enemy within is the worst enemy one can have in life and far be it from us as Igbo Nation that these two zones will push us into political extinction and instead of watching them succeed in their evil ambition, we should show them that we are politically wiser now!The Igbos will always say, “kama ehi gi ga agbanaha gi, gi egbu-biri ya n’odu” which means instead of losing your cow completely while chasing after it you try cutting off and holding onto the tail. This has become the political philosophy of Ndi Igbo now since it has become clear that the Southwest and South South have turned us into political orphans.You will agree with me that it seems no political party will give an Igboman their party ticket because the south south and southwest we helped in 1999 and 2011 suddenly forgot our role. I can't believe that any right thinking Igbo man will agree to support a southwest or South-south man (even as the last option) who will go ahead to pick an Hausa man as running mate, leaving Igbos out of the scheme of things again. While other Igbo politicians are adding up one and one, Gov. Hope Uzodimma the game changer and master planner of Ndi Igbo, a man whose audacity is unequalled, has taken the battle to the war front and since he understands better that politics is all about alignment has started doing the needful for Southeast to remain viable and politically relevant beyond 2023.If Gov. Hope Uzodimma taking the Southeast to align with the Presidential interest of the Northeast will give Southeast a quicker shot at the Presidency in Nigeria then we should move without further delay. Southeast and Northeast share the same political fate since 1999 and it is politically correct for these two marginalized zones to work hand in gloves to actualize a common goal that will be beneficial to both zones now and in the future.Watch closely, Gov. Hope Uzodimma since he assumed office as the Governor, has never made any political mistake. From uniting Ndi Igbo, reclaiming Ebonyi for APC and to pushing the frontiers of Southeast to the Presidency, has ended up galvanising the zone towards political relevance and being the beautiful bride of the nation. Make no mistake about this, the goal is to stop the Southwest and South South as well as anybody working towards relegating Southeast politically now and in the years to come.Under his leadership, all Nigerian political block has visited southeast several times in the space of 2years more than ever. A sign that he is seriously working towards aligning the southeast to the centre. Just as what transpired in the bible in the book of 1 kings 12:16, Southeast has been given the injunction and now we look towards our own political way of making sure we win this war against selfishness, marginalisation, political wickedness and ingratitude by Southwest and South South and we can only win this war by staying united and trusting in the political capacity of Gov. Hope Uzodimma in turning the tides around for our own good.Like I said earlier, any decision Governor Hope Uzodimma is making today, politically, is and will always be in the best interest of Ndi Igbo. Let's rally round and give him maximum support.Dr Ezeafurukwe Paul IhunanyaDG Hope New Media Center","Under Uzodimma, South East Will Never Go Into Political Extinction"
247," I saw this on Facebook, and I decided to share it here on Nairaland..PETER OBI AND HIS  EMOTIONAL POLITICS.By Ayo AllohBefore the campaign started, I tweeted that Peter Obi has a way of winning elections but a lot of people did not understand me. Peter Obi might be the master of emotional politics in Nigeria and I do not refer to the cheap sentiments of having no shoes or having 100 cattles. I am talking of how he convinced the teeming Nigerian youth that he is the best man for the job without big budget TV adverts or posters but by granting interviews and speaking in public fora.At every opportunity Peter appeals to your emotions. He asks you to think of your unborn Children and the next generation. He references his past performance while a governor to prove that he can put Nigeria in the path to greatness. Long ago when Peter Obi moved to PDP from APGA, he already knew this day will come. He has continuously developed himself while also doing public service.I remember when Peter was campaigning for Anambra Governorship election, he visited the king of a riverine community who controls a large bloc of votes that could only be accessed through Canoes because the bridge that leads to that area was bad. Instead of pleading for support, he begged him not to rig the elections but to allow the votes count. Other campaigners gave the King a lot money for his support but Peter only asked for the votes to count.After the election, Peter Obi lost and later on, the King fell sick and was on his dying bed. The King was trying to make amends with all those he had wronged and the King sent emissaries back to Peter Obi to beg him for forgiveness  because he couldn't do what he had promised him. That is the kind of effect Peter Obi has on citizens.The king later died but Peter won his mandate via a tribunal. I know this because the king was living opposite my house in Onitsha and his son was my friend. Fast forward to this day and the greatest hurdle keeping Obi from becoming the President of Nigeria might be the PDP delegates. Obi may have exhausted his message in his political crusade to the delegates but will the delegates prove that they are sophisticated enough to vote with their conscience and not for the highest bidder?

248,"2023: Tambuwal Meets  Borno, Yobe, PDP Delegates,  Garners More Support In Plateau Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, the Sokoto state governor and leading presidential aspirant under the Peoples Democratic Party [PDP] has vowed to revive the Lake Chad Basin agro-ecosystem project to restore livelihood, promote agroforestry and livestock development.Governor Tambuwal who was represented at the consultative meeting by the Chairman of his Presidential Campaign Council, Senator Tunde Ogbeha; had earlier cancelled his consultative engagement to six states of the federation to ensure normalcy is restored in Sokoto state following the killing of a female student at Shehu Shagari College of Education. Speaking on his plans for the North-East, the former Speaker of the House of Representatives promised to strengthen the North-East Development Commission[NEDC] for the total reconstruction of the region.“Aside from the issue of security, two critical issues I have identified for immediate attention are the  Lake Chad Basin agro-ecosystem and repositioning of the North-East Development Commission. If these two critical issues are addressed as well as Security, peace and development will return to the North-east.“On Security, Governor Tambuwal vowed to work closely with countries around the region to curtail the activities of terrorist organisations in the region. Responding, the Borno state PDP chairman, Alhaji Zanna Gadam Mustapha described the governor as a son of the soil and assured him at least 70% of delegates vote come May 28. In the same vein, his Yobe State counterpart, Ambassador Usman El-Gash, described the former Speaker as Presidential material noting that he's convinced that 60% of  Yobe delegates will cast their vote for governor Tambuwal. In Plateau state, the state chairman of the PDP, Hon Chris Hassan, who welcomed Mr Tambuwal’s delegation with music and drumming at the Yakubu Gowon Airport said the governor had at several times come to the aid of the party in Plateau on different occasions and as such, it’s time to return the favour by voting en mass at the May 28 convention in Abuja. Addressing the PDP delegates, Mr Tambuwal promised to promote Tourism, Mining and Agriculture which the people of Plateau are known for. “We know what the people of Plateau want, and by God’s grace, we shall address it. Talk about Agriculture, Tourism, and Mining, I will focus on these critical sectors as well as tackle insecurity in the state. We plan to engage each state according to their needs and want,” Senator Ogbeha who represented Governor Tambuwal said.https://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/05/2023-tambuwal-meets-borno-yobe-pdp-delegates-garners-support-in-plateau/amp/","2023: Tambuwal Meets Borno, Yobe PDP Delegates, Garners More Support In Plateau"

The Nigerian business executive, coach, and speaker,   Wale Olasoji stated this during an exclusive interview with a  correspondent of the Africa Security Investigation News on Friday in Lagos.In his words, ""What I will say to the Nigerian people is that it's not time to give up on the nation. The truth is a lot of people have given up on the country. A lot of people have alleged that there will not be an election, or it will not be free and fair. Well, let's give it a benefit of the doubt to the government. Let's come out in mass and vote for someone you truly believe in. Don't vote for someone who thinks can buy your conscience, don't vote for someone because they gave you money. Try and look at the candidates, look at what they can offer to the nation, and then take a decisive decision on who best to cast your vote for"".Reacting to the increasing level of criminality in the Nigerian community,  Wale Olasoji stated that parents, and the youths have played positively  to the ugly rise in crime.However, he urged the Nigerian government to look inward to fine-tuning the system in such a way it would be favourable for its youths, as, in his opinion, the youths have a large number engaged in crime perpetration in any community.While advising the youths and parents, he said,  ""We have gotten to the point where you have to take your future into your own hands and the beauty of this is, you do not have to wait for anyone. The Government shouldn't be allowed to define your future. No doubt the environment needs to be enabling enough for you to be able to chart a course. But with the internet, the world is a global village you can literally chart a course for yourself. I'm encouraging young people to find role models, and mentors out of people who are doing stuff, and are doing it well. There are vast opportunities all across the globe today. You only need to look for someone who can show you the way and if you get it right. The life will be right for you"", he added. Wale Olasoji while outlining suggestions on how insecurity could be curbed, he has this to say, "" when the young people have things to do, when they're gainfully employed, when you engage them actively, they're going to channel their strength appropriately. Now they are strong, young people are strong people, no dull moments, so they're going to be able to channel their strength into profitable engagements and some of the kidnappings, insecurity we see today Will begin to reduce"".","2023  General Elections: Vote Wisely,- Wale Olasoji Urges Nigerians"
250,"All Protest to Defend the Holy Personality of the Prophet (sa) Should be PeacefulThe recent event in Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto State, where a student was beaten to death for alleged blasphemy is most unfortunate.The Best of Creation, Prophet Muhammad (sa), is the biggest symbol in Islam. There are more than two billion Muslims worldwide, making Islam the second-largest religion in the world, exceeded only by Christianity.Under international laws and convention protesting the abuse of the holy personality of Prophet Muhammad (sa) is a right but such protest should be within the accepted norms and standards. Beating people to death or burning them alive are heinous war crimes.Islam is the only religion in the world when it adherents perpetrate a crime the religion itself is blamed. Some people are blaming Islam for the barbaric murder of Deborah Samuel by those murderous fanatics in Sokoto.When a violent tribal militia group in the South East recently mutilated the private parts of Nigerian army Couple, nobody blamed Christianity. If the perpetrated were Muslims, Islam will be blamed.Hindu extremists are burning Muslims alive in India but nobody is blaming their religion. Islam was made an exception & targeted by the Western hegemony due to it gross failure to defeat the Islamic civilization.The most unfortunate thing is that most rulers of Muslim countries are willing Slaves of the Western hegemonic barbarians who are the biggest enemies of Islam and Muslims in the world. The Saudi regime who host the Ka'aba is at the peak of this betrayal of Islam.It is shameful that some Muslims in Northern Nigeria condoned the extreme barbarism that happened in Sokoto hiding under the guise of love for the Prophet (sa). In Islam the end does not justify the means. The Machiavellian concept of ""The end justify the means"" has no basis in Islam. In Islam, if the end is righteous then the means must be righteous. Defending the holy personality of Prophet Muhammad (sa) is a righteous deeds then the means to achieve that should also be righteous. The barbarism of beating a woman to death and burning her remains is definitely not righteousness.The Sokoto video has now gone viral all over the world. The Islamophobia industry has gotten a new supply of fuel. Condemning this extreme barbarism is the first step to counter the vicious attacks of Islamophobes. Killing people extrajudicially must be condemned. This has no place in civilized societies.On a final note, the Sokoto State government should ensure that those that perpetrated that barbaric slaughter are brought to justice.Harun Elbinawielbinawi@yahoo.comElbinawi.",All Protest To Defend The Holy Personality Of The Prophet (s) Should Be Peaceful

253,"By Esther Daniels Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom has challenged the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC to come clean in its fight against corruption and not be selective as they are currently doing. Governor Ortom spoke Friday, May 13th, 2022 when he received at the Benue Peoples House, a delegation of the Executive Intelligence Management Course 15 participants from the National Institute for Security Studies, Abuja on study tour in the State. The Governor expressed displeasure over the action of the EFCC to freeze the account of the Benue State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA meant to take care of Internally Displaced Persons, IDPs in the State. He questioned the rationale behind the action of the anti-graft agency, stating that the funds in the account were donations from individuals and corporate organizations who were deeply concerned about the plight of the IDPs. According to the Governor, the anti corruption agency has exhibited the height of impunity by its selective war against financial crimes in the country, saying a situation where the EFCC harasses innocent citizens on politically motivated grounds is unacceptable. He tasked the EFCC to beam its searchlight on corrupt serving officials in the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari who have turned the purchase of  presidential nomination forms of the APC for the forthcoming general elections into a bazaar. Governor Ortom also called on the Federal Government to rise to its constitutional responsibility to secure the lives and property of Nigerians, pointing out that if  the country must develop economically, security is paramount. The Governor commended the participants for choosing Benue State as part of their study tour and urged them to take the study seriously and proffer practical solutions to solving the insecurity that has bedeviled the nation. Earlier, leader of the delegation and a directing staff of NISS, Godwin Ometu told the Governor that the course was a flagship programme of NISS and the syndicate 2 was in Benue State to enable participants obtain first-hand information concerning governance, development and security situation. He explained that the course with the theme ""Global Climate Challenge; Prospects and Priorities for Economic Development"" was aimed at fostering interagency synergy and impacting the participants to tackle insecurity challenges, noting that the course participants were drawn from various security formations within and outside Nigeria. He stated that as part of course requirements, the participants at the end of the programme will submit  recommendations and implementation strategies to the Federal Government and requested the Benue State Government to key into the programme.

The Governor who revealed that the coconut oil factory which will be a major foreign exchange earner is expected to create employment for the teeming youths, and will diversify the economy of the state. “Today you are going to witness the first of its kind, you cannot find this kind of factory in Africa that is refining virgin coconut oil with the capacity to process one million nuts a day in three shifts.""""Today we are aware that in the international market virgin crude coconut oil goes for $6 per liter and 221 liters makes one barrel and if the much talked about crude oil is about $110 per barrel it means that virgin coconut oil is $1326 per barrel which is higher than crude oil. Soon everyone is projecting that the demand for crude oil will dwindle in future and we would have been prepared for the future”.       The Chief Executive assured the host community of training the youths, saying “the technology you are seeing here is a combination of Asia and European technology in order to transfer skills and then develop our people. “Let me allay the fears of the host community this week we will draw up an agreement for training and we are taking cognizance of all the three Local Government that have given us land”.

256,"THE CRIMINAL PERPETRATORS MUST BE BROUGHT TO BOOK. Blasphemy, derived from the Latin word Blasphemia, is generally defined as the exhibition of irreverent behaviour or language towards God, religion or anything held sacred. It is a sensitive issue for many, especially those who have an unshakeable faith in their beliefs, religious leaders, holy book, places of worship and rituals.Of great concern at the present time is the subject of whether Islam prescribes any punishment for blasphemy. Every true Muslim loves and regards the Holy Prophet Muhammad(saw), more than any other human being. Many a Muslim may tolerate insults against his parents, relatives or friends, but he cannot endure anyone mocking the Prophet Muhammad(saw). But how exactly does Islam teach a Muslim to respond to insults against the Prophet(saw), or for that matter, insults directed at God or anything sacred in Islam? Unfortunately, many Muslims assert that death or other harsh measures are the only possible punishments for those who commit blasphemy.Prophet Muhammad's life is a beautiful illustration of the word forgiveness, as incidents from his perfect life demonstrate how he pardoned even his worst enemies. For example, the Holy Qur’an records the statement of Abdullah bin Ubayy who, in the company of others, called himself ‘the most exalted’ and referred to Prophet Muhammad (saw) as ‘most mean’. However, Abdullah bin Ubayy was not given any punishment whatsoever and he continued to live peacefully in Madinah until he died a natural death. In fact, the Holy Prophet(saw) himself led his funeral prayer.Another example of the Holy Prophet’s(saw) patient nature is demonstrated when Makkah fell to the Holy Prophet(saw). He pardoned all those who had dismissed him by calling him a sorcerer, madman, & liar.The Holy Prophet(saw) also forgave Abu Sufyan, the Makkan leader who led the most wars against him; Wahshi, who had killed the Holy Prophet’s(saw) own uncle, Hazrat Hamzah(ra); and Hinda, the wife of Abu Sufyan, who had torn out Hadhrat Hamza’s(ra) liver and chewed it out of spite.Furthermore, He also pardoned Habbar, who speared and felled the camel that had been carrying the Holy Prophet’s(saw) daughter, Hadhrat Zainab(ra), from Makkah to Madinah. As a result, Hadhrat Zainab(ra), who was pregnant at the time, miscarried and eventually passed away. And yet the Holy Prophet(saw) forgave even him.But these are just a few instances; the Holy Prophet’s(saw) life is replete with examples of his forgiveness of even his worst enemies. He was more merciful than any person ever born. Indeed, God Himself called the Holy Prophet(saw) a “mercy for all mankind.”Therefore, to kill anyone in the name of blasphemy and claim it is in accordance with the practice of the Holy Prophet(saw) is tantamount to saying that He put to death anyone who by words, either spoken or written, by visible representation or by any imputation, innuendo, or insinuation, directly or indirectly defiled his sacred name. Such a view can only be held by those who take pleasure in destroying others in the name of God—it cannot be supported by the facts of the Holy Prophet’s(saw) life. In fact, such an understanding is just the opposite of what God has said regarding the Holy Prophet’s(saw) treatment of non-Muslims:And it is by the great mercy of Allah that thou art kind towards them, and if thou hadst been rough and hard-hearted, they would surely have dispersed from around thee. So pardon them and ask forgiveness for them, and consult them in matters of administration; and when thou art determined, then put thy trust in Allah. Surely, Allah loves those who put their trust in Him. (Ch.3:V.160)",Murder Of Deborah Yesterday In Sokoto Is Purely Against The Teachings  Of Islam.

America’s JP Morgan has removed the nation from Emerging Market classification, placed country on blacklist to foreign investors; replaced by Serbia and Uzbekistan over the non-transparent deal within the country’s oil sector, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, such that no revenue was paid to the coffers of Nigeria from January to March this year. This caused panic in the global market. JPMorgan removed Nigeria from its list of emerging market sovereign recommendations that investors should be ‘overweight’ in, saying the country had not taken advantage of high oil prices.Analysts use overweight and underweight to broadcast recommendations on buying or avoiding stocks of certain sectors. Analysts attach an overweight recommendation to a stock that they believe will outperform its sector in the near future.According to Reuters, the bank analysts said NNPC did not transfer any revenue to the government from January to March this year due to petrol subsidies and low oil production.The bank further added that it moved Nigeria out of the ‘overweight’ category due to its fiscal woes amid a worsening global risk backdrop that has raised market concerns despite a positive oil environment.On the other hand, JPMorgan replaced Nigeria in the list with Serbia and Uzbekistan in the ‘overweight’ category. According to Reuters, JPMorgan included Serbia in the category due to the country’s high reserves and a fiscally cautious government. At the same time, Uzbekistan was added to the category due to the country’s relatively low debt despite Russian exposure.The bank analysts also revealed that the Emerging Markets Bond Index Global Diversified, EMBIGD, index had dropped 16% this year, “with most of the losses having come from rates” and $4 billion in net outflows from emerging markets since mid-April.They noted that riskier sovereign yields were now 10.6%, the highest level since the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic in April 2020, reducing market access and increasing the risk of debt defaults.https://nigeriastandardnewspaper.com/ng/just-in-americas-jp-morgan-removed-nigeria-from-emerging-market-blacklist-from-foreign-investors-country-out-of-overweight-category-due-to-fiscal-woes-amid-a-worsening-global/",JP Morgan Places Nigeria On Blacklist For Foreign Investors.

A careful comparison of both would help in dividing my thoughts on National issues. Humanity as the quality of being humane while religion is, in fact, a piece of thinking, a notion or belief system of a group of people who worships their Gods. There are many versions of religion, but despite this, in the whole world, the common aspect that unites all the religions is “humanity"". The existence of humanity is a necessary (but not sufficient) prerequisite for the existence of religion. It is therefore prior to, and is therefore more important than, religion. Humanity without humanity, you won’t understand religion.We are all human and we belong to different religions or none. We may not share religious beliefs but we are all human. We have humanity in common which means, logically, that we are united by more than what divides us. We should treasure that which unites us and guard against that which might, if permitted, divide us.Let me borrow the words of Mahatma Gandhi and I qoute:""You must not lose faith in humanity.

279,"Segun Adesina13 May 2022Kindly share this story:Money ritualsFrom the left: Initial preparation as sent by Ifatunde; Ifatunde preparing the money-making charm and Oladipupo The craze for getting stupendously rich through the senseless killing of humans for rituals has reached an alarming crescendo in Nigeria. The phenomenon has thrown families of victims into untold anguish. For two months, posing as a desperate internet fraudster searching for mystical means to acquire wealth, our reporter, using the pseudo name, SEGUN ADESINA, met with herbalists tracked online for helpWhat was uncovered was a frightening, sadistic romance involving young men, voodoo, and traditionalists that are ready markets for booming human parts harvesters.Oladipupo Olalere looked remarkably fresh for an herbalist. His eyes were fixated on a book of mystics propped on his lap. Not even the presence of a potential customer could distract him. He only managed to nod his head to acknowledge the presence of our correspondent, pointed to a weather-beaten wooden bench and went on to flip through the pages of the book, mumbling inanities.The 30-year-old plies his trade somewhere inside the densely populated area of Oja-Oba in Ibadan, Oyo State. His shrine is a ramshackle building sandwiched between two old structures with brown corrugated iron sheets. His dimly lit room was littered with fetish objects, mostly wrapped in red cloth. While some were displayed on wooden tables, others thickly coated with dust, hung loosely on the dirt-stained wall. Inside the room, which was crammed with other odd-looking objects, was an area demarcated with a cream cloth.Staring at the space generated an eerie feeling as it oozed secrecy. From all indications, it was not meant for prying eyes. Before the visit, our correspondent had been in talks with the herbalist, who has over four thousand followers “liking and sharing” his fetish suggestions.Known as Ifatunde Ifayemi on Facebook, his timeline is littered with adverts beckoning on individuals interested in all manner of charms, especially those that hold great promises for individuals seeking avenues to get rich mysteriously.With his page, a beehive of interactions, he constantly fed fans with content that boasts his mystical powers and deep-rooted traditional beliefs. With flagrant disregard for identity protection, he flaunts his clients as a way to prove his success rate as a money-ritual guru. Oladipupo flanked on both sides by two clientsIt was from one of his posts that our correspondent got his phone number and began a negotiation that, with time, led to a face-to-face meeting.Initially, when the conversation was initiated, the picture painted by our correspondent to Oladipupo was one of a frustrated Yahoo boy (Internet fraudster) faced with a life of struggle and lack, and was ready to stake his neck to hit the goldmine through money ritual.A journey into the mysteriousExcited by the call from not only a new client but one ready to go the whole hog, Oladipupo, with-no-holds barred, revealed and explained coded traditional terminologies, which he said were only known by money ritual underdogs.PUNCH Investigations gathered from him that various types of money rituals had their attached consequences. Oladipupo said the two in high demand were ‘Osole Gbigbona,’ which required human parts, and ‘Osole Tutu,’ the one prepared with animal parts.Following promises by our correspondent to ensure a huge return after hitting it big and sensing his desperation, the herbalist voluntarily opted to prepare the ‘Osole Gbigbona’ money ritual.While still marketing the extraordinary potency of this particular charm, he warned that it would cost quite a lump sum of money. Still, he refused to divulge the amount on the phone. Oladipupo later gave our correspondent an address in Ibadan for a physical meeting to finalise the arrangement.Meeting days later, Oladipupo ranted about popularly held perceptions on the potency of money rituals and boasted about a sizeable number of Nigerians he had made stupendously rich. The conversation, which was more of a self-advertisement, appeared to be a mind-playing gimmick meant to mentally prepare our correspondent for what was ahead.He said, “Osole Gbigbona is real. Some are more potent and effective than others. I have done so many money rituals. From Abuja to Abakaliki, I transfer the charms. I have clients abroad and send the charms through courier,” he boasted with a glint in his eyes.Oladipupo said he relocated to Ibadan from Ogun State because of the huge patronage he enjoys from mostly young Internet fraudsters.He said, “I have more customers in Ibadan than Ijebu Ode. You know that a prophet is not respected in his own town. I have customers that sometimes lodge in hotels for weeks, and when it’s time to eat the concoction made for them or to collect the charms, they will come to my place. Two friends came to me from Abuja and another from Abakaliki. I posted about them on my timeline,” he said.A vivid description of the individuals matched some uploaded pictures discovered on his Facebook page by PUNCH Investigations.The actual cost of money rituals made with human partsDelving deeper into the mystery, Oladipupo explained what each money ritual entailed and asked our correspondent, “Do you want the one that will yield money immediately or that which would make people start rendering monetary favours to you? “There is money-making soap that will be prepared for you with parts of a dead body. When bathing with it, the dead body will appear. You may not see the spirit, but you will hear words like ‘give me my head or give me my flesh,’ depending on the part used. The potion prepared with body parts is more potent than those made with the head of lizards or other animals.”Our correspondent asked for the cost after Oladipupo’s earlier advice to go for the money ritual prepared with human parts due to its efficacy.Ingredients for rituals bought by Ifatunde.“Osole Gbigbona will cost you N250, 000. I am offering you this charm at a cheap price. If you can get me the money, you will have so much money within one week. You will see money and become afraid,” he blurted with accompanying incantations.The herbalist further boasted that the charm prepared with human parts can last for three years, adding, “By the time it expires, you would have made more than enough money.”Asked if there are accompanying repercussions, Oladipupo answered, “Since you are not the one that killed the person, there won’t be any problem.”Pretending to be pleased and convinced, our correspondent asked Oladipupo for his bank details, promising to transfer the amount needed for the money ritual once he gets to Lagos.Surprising ease of obtaining human partsBefore taking his leave, pretending to be worried, our correspondent asked the herbalist how he intended to source the human parts required for the money ritual.He dismissively answered that he was unaware but later said it could be harvested from accident victims or dead bodies.After a deep thought, he (herbalist) claimed to also source from herb sellers and “from old members of Oduduwa People Congress.”In order not to arouse suspicion by probing further, our correspondent left with a promise to transfer the N250,000.However, three days later, instead of returning with the money, our correspondent called to make an odd urgent request – to procure a human toe for personal reasons.Without hesitating, Oladipupo promised to contact his supplier and revert back on the price and mode of delivery.A few minutes later, he called back with the news that the toe could be delivered at any location. He (herbalist) was ready to act as a middle man to broker the deal. Read AlsoI feel damaged for life, says 24-year-old lady allegedly defiled at childhood by uncle, dad’s friendOsun truck repairer caught removing corpse teeth for ritualNollywood not responsible for increase in money rituals —Branch, Dike, Oworu, OjefuaHe revealed that it would cost N50,000, but after negotiation, the duo settled for N40,000.“Once you send money and it is confirmed, I will get it from the supplier and bring it to your place. If you send the money today, I will bring it to Lagos today. My delivery fee is N5,000,” he said.PUNCH Investigations, however, aborted the mission by not contacting Oladipupo, as it was unclear where the toe would be sourced from.It is worth noting that the transaction was hinged on an agreement of payment before the supplier would source for it.After two weeks of silence, the herbalist sent a message to our correspondent to find out why he had yet to hear from him, but he got no response.Enter Ifatunde, 19-year-old herbalist cum swindlerIn Oyo State, Ifatunde, a 19-year-old, who hoodwinked our correspondent into believing he was in his 70s, held sway.He was the second herbalist that PUNCH Investigations’ search unearthed on Facebook and was contacted via a number advertised on his posts. In what could pass as a veiled attempt to deceive desperate victims, Ifatunde had the ‘Odu Ifa Corpus’ symbol as his profile picture.However, PUNCH Investigations stumbled on another of his Facebook accounts with another mystical symbol used as a display picture through a WhatsApp number given to our correspondent by the herbalist, which he claimed belonged to his son.Findings showed that the first Facebook account had 2,140 friends, while the second had 1,000.He spoke with an unadulterated Ibadan accent in a series of telephone conversations with our correspondent that spanned two weeks. He pretended to be a gruffly old man. He continuously referred to our correspondent as ‘Omo mi’ (my child).Still sounding like a desperate Internet fraudster, our correspondent reeled out why he needed to become rich. Ifatunde wasted no time boasting that he possessed the ultimate mystical power to conjure wealth and success.However, his bill was small compared to that of the Ibadan-based herbalist.“Are you ready for it now?,” he asked after days of back and forth on the phone with our correspondent. “I will charge N95,000 for the one that needs human parts. Since you are 30 years old, there is no problem. If you are not up to a certain age, you cannot use it. Some people that are 19 and 20 years old have approached me, and they got what they wanted. Put your mind at rest,” he said.After pleading with Ifatunde to reduce the fee, the amount was brought down to N40,000. It was agreed that the amount would be paid in two instalments of N20,000.The herbalist explained that the deposit would be used to buy the human parts and other items needed to perform a particular sacrifice. At the same time, the balance of N20,000, would be paid once the charm was ready.“I will do it for you. I hope you won’t be an ingrate because the N40,000 is too small. Do you have the money with you now,” he asked.However, the money ritual came with a clause – no physical meeting between him and our correspondent until the charm is ready.“Seeing me would render the charm useless,” he warned.In what appeared to be a tactic to avoid being traced, Ifatunde requested that the money be transferred to a POS operator, claiming to have issues with his bank account but when our correspondent insisted on paying through a bank or back out, he agreed to send the bank details of his son.He kept demanding moreAfter an account with the name Promise Oyewole was sent, the first instalment of N20,000 was paid. However, two days later, Ifa Tunde called to demand an additional N10,000 to purchase ‘essential materials’. He claimed the N20,000 was insufficient and highlighted the dangers of aborting the ritual halfway. The money was sent but with an agreement that only a balance of N10,000 would be paid when the charm was ready.Surprisingly, the herbalist called the next day to demand another N20,000, to carry out another special sacrifice to fortify the money ritual. He said, “Something appeared to me last night, and I had to suspend the preparation. Before I finish the process, we need to make a sacrifice. I saw something with positive and negative side effects. If the sacrifice is made and you start using the charm, you will get results within three days, but if not, it won’t work.“It seems that you have been using other charms before now, and they don’t work. I don’t want that to happen again. And you know that there is no way we can perform the sacrifice without money. N20,000 should be enough.”At this point, it dawned on our correspondent that he could possibly be dealing with an Internet fraudster masquerading as an herbalist.Our correspondent offered to bring the N20,000 to his shrine, pretending to play along. Still, Ifatunde refused and voiced fears that it portended danger.He referred to an earlier discussion wherein he warned that the charm forbade any physical meeting with a client. Instead, he proposed sending his son, Promise. “He would wait for you by the roadside at Ipeba to collect the money,” he said.Findings by PUNCH Investigations showed that Ipeba is a remote village along the Ogbomoso-Oyo Road.To be continuedhttps://punchng.com/inside-the-world-of-nigerias-deadly-money-ritualists-where-human-parts-are-traded-like-commodities-1/?utm_term=Autofeed&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Facebook#Echobox=1652427370Lalasticlala Lalasticlala",Skull Mining: Oyo Begins To Compete With Ogun In Rituals Supremacy (pix)

281,"The word Biafra owes its origins from old Portogese maps detailing the now Bight of Guinea.The original name of the Bight of Guinea was Bight of Mafra.Mafra being a Portogese slaving port in present day Cameron that was named after the Portogese port city of Mafra which was a major rallying port for Portogese slavers.Along the coastal areas of west Africa starting at present day Togo, the Portogese named their ports of calling after cities in Portugal.So we have Porto Novo in Togo, Lagos in Eko , Escravos and Forcados in present day Delta, Marfra  in Cameron, Malabu and Fernando Po in Equatorial Guinea The original rendition n Portogese maps was Bight of Mafra and written in short hand as ""Bi. Mafra"" just as you will see ""Isle"" in place of Island.Over the years it came to be known as Biafra . This may be as a result of other European sailing expeditions mistaken the area as Biafra since the maps may have degraded over the years and difficult to read and new reproductions based on the original Portogese maps rendered it as ""Biafra"" instead of ""Bight of Mafra"".We could also explain this as not a mistake but a deliberate renaming by the British from the original Portogese rendition so as to deny any future claims of the area by Portugal. The scramble for Africa was going on at this time and so competiting European powers would rename areas that fell into their control.The word Biafra had nothing to do with the Igbo language as postulated by that great ignorance peddling swill known as Radio Biafra. According to Radio Biafra , the word came from two Igbo words : "" Bia"" and ""Fra"" meaning come and go in the Igbo tongue. This is highly unlikely as the first use of the word was to designate the adjourning waters close to the Portogese port of Mafra in Cameron and for the obvious fact that the igbos  were not known as a sea fearing people and their enclaves were far into the hinterland and never by the coastal areas.The irony here is how Igbos named their nation after a major Slaving port in Portugal .",Biafra: How The Igbos Named Their Nation After A Slave Port

286,"Kayode OyeroAbdulmumin Jibrin, a top campaigner for All Progressives Congress chieftain, Bola Tinubu, has given reasons for dumping the presidential campaign of the ex-governor of Lagos State.In a statement on Saturday, Jibrin said he had no choice but to quit Tinubu’s campaign after his exit from the APC to the New Nigeria People’s Party led by former Kano State governor and NNPP presidential aspirant, Rabiu Kwankwaso.The former member of the House of Representatives, however, reiterated that he had no issues with Tinubu but with Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano.In his statement titled, ‘Why I left the APC – Hon Abdulmumin Jibrin’, the ex-lawmaker said his political life had been miserable in the last seven years due to the overbearing nature of the party’s leaders in his home state.He said, “In my twenty-three years of postgraduate experience, the last seven years were my most unremarkable, so much that my long-established career almost reached a point of utter implosion…“The horrifying disappointments of my past seven years revolved around this character who’s determined to destroy anybody that activates his glaring inferiority complex. His sadistic instincts make him quite a frightening ally, so much that he feels the need to treat his allies as the marginalized black Africans in apartheid-era South Africans to feel a sense of superiority and misguided advantage. I dedicated everything to the political interests of this man, but he kept asking for more. This circus became too embarrassing that I had to take a step back for soul-searching to redeem myself. There’s a difference between service for the common good and a quest to be worshipped by one’s allies. We must never confuse loyalty with slavery.”“This man yearned for that and put me through a mentally draining phase in my life that I had to step aside to reflect on my political choices. It’s unsurprising that all his political principals and lieutenants are deserting him, and he risks becoming an island at the end of his stewardship. “When he tried to lure me back a few days ago in a lengthy phone conversation, I asked him a question to stir up deep introspection on his demoralizing interpersonal relations. I asked if, as a father, he would want others to treat his children in the fashion he treats us his political allies and lieutenants. At the appropriate time, I intend to discuss the viciousness of this man in detail,” he added.Continuing, Jibrin said, “However, my exit from the APC means I’ve ceased to be involved in the presidential campaign of Alhaji Bola Ahmed Tinubu. The fact is, no individual can be a significant minus in Asiwaju’s campaign. The campaign is armor-built and designed to excel even without me. Based on the passion and dedication of the team invested in his aspiration, not even Asiwaju can stop his campaign let alone an Abdulmumin Jibrin.“I want to appeal to the public to avoid overestimating my relevance to the team and stop the rumour and creating all sort of theories around this matter. I have my value but it will not take away anything from the menu I saw on the BAT campaign table.“For the avoidance of doubt, let me clarify that I have no problem whatsoever with Asiwaju. We have never for once had issues. My problems were local and all politics are local. Asiwaju took a sincere interest in me and gave me the free hands to participate in his project, and my exit from the party doesn’t erase my respect for him and belief in his capacity and vision to redeem the fortunes of Nigeria.“Asiwaju did his best to intervene to prevent my exit from the party. Not because it would affect his campaign in any way but for the genuine likeness he has for me. Unfortunately, wherever this man after my career function, I feel a sense of obligation to flee for my political safety. It’s one toxicity I’m no longer prepared to endure, and I do want to use this opportunity to apologize to the entire BAT family across the country for whatever embarrassment or inconvenience my sudden exit from the APC must’ve caused.“I have already met Asiwaju to tender my apology, and he will continue to be a father to me and his house, my home.”https://punchng.com/why-i-quit-tinubus-presidential-campaign-jibrin/Lalasticlala",Why I Quit Tinubu’s Presidential Campaign —jibrin

Drums Support for Akpabio's Presidential AmbitionA Law luminary aspiring on the platform of All Progressives Congress (APC), to represent Ikot Ekpene/Essien Udim/Obot Akara Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives in 2023, Patrick Umoh, has said he has requisite experience to represent the constituency, even as he promised to facilitate legislation for the development of the three Local Government Areas, when elected.Patrick, a Knight of Saint John, dropped the hint, Saturday, while fielding questions from TheHILL Reporter in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital.Dr. Umoh, a former Secretary, Obot Akara Local Government Council, opined that, it would be in the best interest of the people to send a lawyer into a law-making institution.His words: “I’m someone with a multidisciplinary background and I will use this to the advantage of our people.“As a matter of fact, I have important bills and motions that I’m going to move within the first 10 days if I’m sworn in as the representative of the Federal Constituency. And by the time we are three months old in office, our people will nod their heads in affirmation that indeed, the difference is clear.""The youthful aspirant who pledged to change the narrative of representation by attracting development to the Federal Constituency, said he will also focus on women and youth empowerment.""I intend to adopt the bottom-top approach. With this approach, we will periodically hold town hall meetings where the issues in each community and its people will be tabled and jointly discuss on how to address them. This is not rocket science.""Again, we will not be involved in providing water to a community where in fact their actual need is an access road and bridge or providing fertilizers to farmers whereas what they need is a soft loan to boost their farms.""As for the youths and women that are the centre-point of my policy, aside from proving a safe and enabling environment for them to succeed in their craft, they will be trained and provided with starter packs for the training they will receive.“When you empower women, you empower the nation while investment in youths will translate to nation building. By the grace of God, we will give our people the best empowerment in the history of empowerments in this constituency. Our investment will go beyond giving our constituents money and tools, we will follow through the process to ensure they recorded success,” Umoh noted.The Obot Akara born law luminary used the occasion and called on Nigerians to support the aspiration of the former Minister, Niger Delta Affairs and Leader of APC in Akwa Ibom, Senator Godswill Akpabio, to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari, who will be completing his tenure by May 29 next year.He boasted that, the name Godswill Akpabio is synonymous with Uncommon Transformation as he is the only Presidential aspirant with the Midas touch who will turn all facets of the country's economy to gold as he did in Akwa Ibom when he was the Governor.“I plead with my party the APC and all Nigerians to give Senator Godswill Akpabio the chance to lead us in the next dispensation beacause he has bold and innovative ideas to improve security and solve other challenges facing the country,"" Dr. Umoh stated.","I've Requisite Experience For Legislative Business, Best Representation - Umoh"

Chief of Staff to the Governor, Emeka Woke led police officials from Government House to the Court.“In fact, the Police forcefully brought Hon.

307,"For the second time in the life of this administration, President Muhammadu Buhari visited Ebonyi State last week, commissioned landmark projects, and equally passed the night. Rare, very rare on visits to States.The President has 36 Governors to relate with, and possibly contend with. Political party would not matter, as he is the father of all. And good fathers, they say, should not like a child more than the other. Even if they do, they should not show it, for the sake of domestic concord and amity.But I can wager that this President loves Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State. Why and how? We will come to that later.Landing at Akanu Ibiam International Airport in the Presidential jet Nigerian Air Force 001, we continued the trip to Ebonyi in helicopters. And we entered the State through Osborn La Palm Event Centre, Uburu, in Ohaozara Local Government Area, where the Governor hails from. The man has made sure that development reached his own very community, and copiously too.From there, we proceeded to the King David University of Medical Sciences, Uburu, built by the State Government. I had last December written on the state of the art university, with ultra-modern facilities. You wonder how a state like Ebonyi, not earning derivation from oil money, could put up such a showpiece. It is one of the wonders of David Umahi in Ebonyi.Very significant to me was something that happened as our convoy snaked its way towards the university. About five boys, most likely between ages 3 and 5, stood by the roadside, and were waving at us cheerily. Two of them didn’t wear knickers, and you could see their tiny ‘things’ peeping from in between their thighs. They didn’t care a hoot if anybody was looking at them. They were happy to see the motorcade, and nothing else mattered in the whole world. They kept waving delightfully till we went out of their sight.Childhood. Innocence. No bile, no guile, no malice. Those boys obviously knew nothing called Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). Nor do they know the Eastern Security Network (ESN). They were just creations of God with pure souls, no murderous inclinations, no corroding thoughts of marginalization, real or imagined.Oh, that mankind could return to the original way in which we were created. What Heaven this earth would be. Make me like a child again. Make me gentle and trusting. Let little children come unto me, for of such is the Kingdom of God. The world as God made it is one thing, and the world as man mars it is another thing. May those boys maintain the kind of heart they displayed, for life. Amen.In that neighborhood, President Buhari commissioned twin flyover bridges, 12 kilometers dualized Federal road from Mbu, Enugu State to Uburu, Ebonyi State. And then the eye-popping university building, facilities and equipment.Also inaugurated that day were the International Airport at Onueke, including the Airport lounge and five kilometers dualized road. Others were a new Governor’s Lodge, office complex for the Governor’s wife, Margaret Umahi International Market Complex, the wondrous Light Tunnel Flyover, and Ebonyi Shopping Mall, which compares with any other you see in other developed countries of the world.So delighted was President Buhari with all he saw, that he declared: “It has always been a pleasure coming to Ebonyi State. The last time I came was in 2017 in the 2nd quarter of the first tenure of Governor Umahi’s administration. I witnessed the commencement of mind blowing projects. I saw in Governor Umahi a strong desire to change the narrative of the State, and meet the aspirations of the founding fathers.”The President, at a State Banquet that night recalled that he was given two traditional titles in 2017. The Enyioha 1 of Ebonyi State, and Ochioha 1 of South East.On day two of the visit, President Buhari commissioned another befitting edifice, the new Executive Council Chambers, where he also held a meeting with illustrious leaders of the South East.Now, to the crux of the matter. Why does the President love this Governor, so much so that he has paid two State Visits, and passed the night at both times?Governor Umahi loves and serves his people, and that is evidenced in how he has changed the face and landscape of the State. Old, rustic Abakaliki has suddenly become like any other modern city of the world. President Buhari loves infrastructural development, as seen in roads, rail, bridges, airports, and many others round the country. He sees Umahi doing the same thing, and he just loves it. At the time Umahi was still in the opposition People’s Democratic Party, it didn’t stop the President loving him.Umahi is forthright. No beating about the bush. At a time he saw that it was more in the interest of his people and State to be in the party at the center, he joined the All Progressives Congress, APC.Said the President: “I am honored that in the life of my administration, Ebonyi State Government and her people made the right choice to join our progressive party, APC. I commend the Governor for the courage to join the party at the center, and for all his contributions in moving our nation forward.”For the courage he displays, the President loves Umahi.Another reason. For touching the lives of the people through his projects and policies. Hear the President again:“You have done your people proud. I am particularly amazed by the economic development records of the State under your administration, the wonderful network of roads, critical infrastructure and investment opportunities in the State. ..I commend the State for emerging as the second overall best in fiscal performance in Nigeria and for soaring high in fiscal discipline, transparency and accountability in the use of public resources.”Touch the lives of the people. Utilize their money and resources to improve their lot, and Buhari would love you. That is why he loves Umahi.Umahi got nearly everything he requested for. He asked the Federal Government to take over the University of Medical Sciences, the President acceded. He asked for assistance to buy Airport equipment, the President promised to look into it. He named a number of projects after a normally self-effacing President Buhari, whom I’ve seen turn down such requests, but the President said yes to Umahi. Greater love hath no man than this...At the meeting with leaders of the South East, two requests resonated. The release of leader of the outlawed IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu, and the ceding of power to the region, so that there could be a President of South East extraction in 2023.On the first request, the President maintained a position he had always upheld. The case was before the courts, and the onus was on the judiciary to adjudicate.

309,"Yesterday, a certain sit at home terror message released by one boy was being mindlessly circulated in the social media. I don't know whether our people lost their most basic reasoning capacity since these criminal sit at homes started.Why share a terrorist message? For what purpose exactly? To save lives? NO, YOU ARE ONLY CONTRIBUTING TO THE TAKING OF LIVES!Let me put it this way: If for example a terrorist group released a message, and NOBODY shared it, or it was ignored in the main, what would really happen, and for how long? Just think of it...Assuming that, due to people not sharing these terrorist messages, that a group of about 100 terrorists came out on a day that millions of people are going about their business; what can these terrorists do really? On any given day in Nnewi or Onitsha or Awka, MILLIONS of people come out to do their businesses. Assuming these terrorists came out on such a day, how many people can they kill before they are mobbed and burned to death by the angry MILLIONS of people? In the era gone by, unarmed Igbo people routinely arrested heavily armed robbers in Onitsha and burnt them to death.Go and check! You see, these terrorists are relying on your sharing of their terror messages to command and control millions of you with little effort and almost zero resistance. And, on the day they designate as sit at home, only very few people come out, thereby enabling the terrorist to easily dominate them, operate and get away. If only 100 people are on the street when 50 terrorists are operating, you see why the terrorists operate successfully and get away? Can that happen if MILLIONS of people are out? Nope! I've seen videos where a handful of these guys were operating on completely deserted streets. That is HOW they operate. When nobody is outside, nobody can threaten them. When the sit at home was popular among our people, people simply sat home without being forced by anyone. But since criminal terrorists hijacked it, people are now frightened into sitting at home, for absolutely no reason. Even Nnamdi Kanu has condemned these terrorist killers of Ndigbo. He called it ""sacrilegious"".  Nnamdi Kanu has consistently condemned shedding of Igbo blood in Igboland. But these terrorists are trying to take over our land and governance without OUR referendum or vote. The boy I referred to above was speaking with an accent that is not central Igbo, and you can guess where he is from.   Ndigbo, there is a simple thing you can do to cripple these terrorists: JUST STOP SHARING THEIR MESSAGES!By sharing their messages, you are NOT saving lives: You are aiding and abetting terrorists and helping them to continue killing you and destroying your business in your ancestral land!I have since removed myself from every Whataspp group that shares such messages. You should, too .If you don't share terror messages, millions of our people will stop seeing them, and start taking back their land and their lives gradually. STOP SHARING MESSAGES RELEASED BY TERRORISTS!  When they see that their messages have stopped reaching people, they will be put out of the business of terror.",Stop Sharing Sit At Home Messages Released By Criminals In South East

313,"OUK's Stellar Performance In Abia Development: 1999-2007 Under ReviewIn politics we do not attack individuals but issues. If anyone has issues with OUK including Odo who has comparatively decided to play to political galleries, Igbere or Abuja could be reached to iron out such issues.OUK, like him or hate him is a Political Iroko in Nigeria. He may not be a Saint, but when he was Governor salaries were paid as at and when due through out his tenure that spanned 1999 to 2007. Gratuities were paid to retired staff throughout this period under consideration. Teachers and other civil servants were able to build houses, bought cars and there was also Free Education in the State.ABSU was given its due monthly subvention and was then rated as one of the best managed schools in Nigeria. Faculty of law under Prof Ojukwu as Dean of the Faculty of Law was rated the best in Nigeria and that was under OUK. Roads were ubiquitously built in Abia State but were not maintained from 2007. He was the only voice in Igbo Land!Back home, there is no single project one can say was attracted by any government in Ohafia from 1999 todate apart from those built by OUK. In particular OUK built Amangwu Road, OUK built Okon Aku Road, OUK built Amuma through Ndi Ibe Roads. He reconstructed Ebem-Asaga Roads that were destroyed after the civil war.As a Senator, just within 30 days of his being at the Red Chamber he fought and became the Chief Whip of the Senate and within the three years justified his being there by scattering meaningful and developmental projects (53 roads and still counting) across the five local government areas that made up Abia North, namely Ohafia, Arochukwu, Bende, Umunneochi and Isiukwuato. In particular we have so many roads he has attracted in Ohafia LGA including but not limited to Abia, Isiugwu, Abiriba ring Road, Nkporo by Eze Aja Road, Itumbu Uzo Road, Ntalakwu Road Bende, Eziama Road Isiukwuato and Umunneochi Link Road and others too numerous to mention.OUK in his time allowed democracy to flourish especially at the local government level. For example in Ohafia LGA where l was the Boss between 2004 to 2006, we had ANPP councillor in the person of Mr. UDONSI Eke Kalu(UDAIK) from Okon, AD councillor in the person of Mrs Grace Agbara from Ameke Abiriba, NDP councillor in the person of Mr Eke Idika Uwa from Akanu Ukwu, and others from ANPP were ABACHA from Ndi Ufie Ward Nkporo, HILARY from Ania Ward. Others came from PDP including my humble self.That was democracy in action. What do we have now? One party system!!Because OUK gave us free hand we were able to pay local government staff as at and when due. Salaries were paid every 23rd of the month throughout our tenure. What is the position today? Workers are owed over 23 months Salaries and are placed on half Salaries whenever they want to pay. Odo will not write on this issue! We opened Ohafia development because we attracted ZENITH BANK, ECO BANK and Micro Finance Banks because the allocation from the Federal Government was domiciled in Ohafia and no more Umuahia as it were. Again OUK gave us free hand to employ Ohafia people into the local government system. Hitherto, the system employed only Ngwa and Umuahia people because nobody stood for our people. Today, I am proud to say that the workforce from Ohafia in the system constitutes about 85%! We completed the Okon Aku health Centre through their Councillor Hon Udensi Eke Kalu (UDAIK), we built IYI AKARANI BRIDGE ASAGA and the contact was awarded to Prince Ndubuisi Onugu, ASAGA has been developed as a result of that project. We were the first LGA in Abia State to do asphalting and through that we opened the Ohafia ring Road that transversed through late Chief Ojigwe's House up to Timber Shed road Ebem Ohafia and this has made it possible for people going to Asaga, Okon, Amangwu, Ndi Orieke, etc, Akanu, Ndi Uduma, Abia, Arochukwu to have alternative road whenever there's hold up at Ebem Park. We also built the Ebem Daily Market, we recovered Egbe Mburumaja erosion in Akanu adjacent to High Chief Uche Ogboso's House. We also brought down Abia hill through the invitation of Dr Uchendu of then PG of Abia Community. At Isiama we constructed the dual drainage from the General Hospital Amekpu close to Hon Sampson Anaga's House at Okagwe. Without the drainage on both sides of the road, probably most probably the road would have collapsed. We rebuilt Abiriba Customary Court and Ekpekuma Health Centre. We built Iroyi Bridge at Nkporo, we started Nkporo Police Station, and renovated many schools in Ohafia LGA. We attracted all the Health Centres in Ohafia LGA that our people are enjoying today. We brought peace at Eziafor Ohafia without compromise. Within the 2 years in office we graded all the Wards in Ohafia and that was made possible because OUK gave us free hand to operate. All the Councillors in the system then built one or two projects in their various Wards. What is the position today The local government system properly so called is dead and buried! What is in place is what they call Transition Chairman in the system which is alien to our Constitution, yet people like Odo are so blind not to tackle on the issue but will at every slippery opportunity find pleasure to attack OUK.For the avoidance of any iota, modicum or scintillia of doubt OUK is an outstanding polical figure in Nigeria. He is an enigma and has over grown party-politics. He is the man of the people and this was made possible by his developmental projects and God on his side. Whether PDP, APC, APGA, ANNP or even APP, these parties and indeed the PEOPLE will at all times embrace OUK in any context.Last Line: Allowance has been given to some political merchants struggling in vain to be relevant, attacking OUK unjustly through name calling. Yes we have freedom of speech and Freedom of Information, but there must be a limit to it. Where your freedom stops is where another's begins. Allowance has been given for immature perception of what is governance and that allowance has to stop somewhere! Nigeria is a country with robust legal system; even under military regime, the legal system is no respecter of anyone, government principalities, government powers and the likes including those hiding under free speech to bring down our Leaders. As things unfold we are poised henceforth to bring such people before a competent court to defend some of their utterances that negate constitutional democracy.Barrister Emeka Kalu, Former Ohafia LGA Chairman.https://osunreporters.com/2022/05/ouks-stellar-performance-in-abia-development-1999-2007-under-review-barr-emeka-kalu/",Ouk's Stellar Performance In Abia Development: 1999-2007 Under Review

He said a lot of things that are not right about the prophet of Allah and in Sokoto, I said he was courageous. For us, we kill such a person. For the prophet of Allah, the least we can do is to kill. ""We are not like Muslims, because Kano Muslims are more like merchants. That's why when they insulted the prophet as one practising sodomy, no action was taken. They insulted the prophet and called him an adulterer and paedophile, yet no action was taken but here in Sokoto, we kill such people. ""Anyone who insults the prophet, our duty is to kill such a person. If they claim the man who blasphemously insulted the prophet was mad, we're also a bunch of mad people here in Sokoto. ""The extent of our sanity is proportional to how someone attacks our holy prophet. Once he's attacked, we're mad enough to strike. I'm speaking the truth; may God bless the people of Sokoto for defending the prophet's integrity. ""Any Muslim faithful who joined the demonstration to the palace of Sultan of Sokoto has demonstrated enough evidence that he is a true discipline of Danfodio. ""Once he is out of the police custody, take action; assassinate the blasphemer. The claim of insanity to protect him is invalid. If he's mentally deranged and would not insult anyone except the prophet; then we're also insane once the prophet is insulted. ""Kill him once you see him. Not just him but anyone who insults the prophet.” ""There's no other punishment other than death for insulting the prophet of Islam. Even if the person is a Muslim, he must be assassinated,"" he added.http://saharareporters.com/2022/05/13/sokoto-based-islamic-preacher-urges-muslims-kill-blasphemers-says-its-least-they-can-do","Sokoto-based Islamic Preacher Urges Muslims To Kill Blasphemers, Says It's The L"

I had such high hopes that things will eventually get better, even as it get worst.3.

Resource will be the focus of leaders“This means, to some extend, it is better for people to keep dying and giving up on the country than to live and stay here.“The more they die or suffer or vacate the country, the less competition and pressure on the resources.

I Amadi-Nna of a Magistrate Court on April 29, but the case was adjourned till May 9 for the charge to be amended following arguments that a Magistrate Court cannot hear matters relating to cultism.On the adjourned date, the case was moved to the State High Court, but Dagogo could not be produced in court on the ground that he was being managed for some health challenges.While the case was later adjourned till Monday next week for mention at the Rivers State High Court, the matter was brought forward for Friday.Source;https://www.channelstv.com/2022/05/13/rivers-court-remands-lawmaker-granted-bail-by-federal-court/",Farah Dagogo: Rivers Court Remands Lawmaker Granted Bail By Federal Court
323,"PDP PARTY DELEGATES IN ENUGU STATE AND ALL RELEVANT PARTY STAKEHOLDERS HAVE BEEN URGED NOT TO BE INTIMIDATED. The battle for the seat of the next governor of Enugu state is getting intense; about eighteen candidates eyeing the seat from Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) alone have purchased the governorship form and expression of interest, three from APGA and few from other parties in the state. A credible leader and better governance is what Enugu deserves right now and there should be no room for incompetency, gamble or sentiment in choosing the next Executive Governor of Enugu State in 2023. It is an issue that concerns the people of Enugu, sons and daughters across sections encompassing class, age, belief systems and political backgrounds. Many have decried the lack of major project being embarked on in the state for years, no attempt to empower the youths, roads being dilapidated and many businesses closing down on daily bases. Many have zero confidence in the present administration but have vowed not to seat and watch the same people who always shun credibility, impose the next state governor on them.Members of the Peoples Democratic Party PDP in the state are afraid not to lose the state to another political party, due to the abysmal rating of this administration and have kicked against the Governor’s moves to impose a governorship candidate on them for 2023 election. They also maintained that PDP as a party has no zoning system both in National and State level and have always provided a neutral play ground for the best governorship candidate to emerge from any zone both in National and at State level.It has also been advised that the best PDP Enugu can do for itself is to present to the party and the entire people of the state the best of the best based on credibility, and this can be achieved using ones past political and economic antecedents as a yardstick thereby eschewing rancor, acrimony or hatred. The onus lies on the party to come forth with a governorship candidate who will be acceptable by the people of Enugu State irrespective of the zone he comes from.Going by the recent poll conducted in Enugu which shows that Sen. Prof. Ike Ekweremmadu is the most viable candidate that is highly rated among others vying for the position not only in PDP but in all the political parties in the state and the support he has garnered is overwhelming. Being widely accepted by the old and young in the state has become a discussion of its own as most executive members of the People’s Democratic Party in the state, including traditional rulers have given the warning against presenting a candidate with dubious antecedents which will make party's aspiration, dead on arrival. They stated that once a candidate is not credible, it means he lacks some essential criterion that will hamper the winning chances of the party in the upcoming elections. They also called on those clamoring for UNCONSTITUTIONAL PARTY ZONING SYSTEM in the state to sheath their swords and support Sen. Prof. Ike Ekweremmadu as he’s the right and most credible candidate to move the state to greater heights. As one vying for the number one position of a state, a track record of excellent accomplishments that the masses can identify with should herald his/her campaign as collective experience gained on the course of service to humanity is of tremendous advantage and as such the imposition of a candidate by one or two individuals must be condemned in its entirety and the society destroying cancer called ""god-fatherism"" should be checked and expunged completely to prevent further leakages of the state resources. They added that all PDP party delegates in Enugu state in collaboration with relevant party stakeholders should not be intimidated by anyone and have a pressing need to utilize the limited time available to do what is right for the party by supporting and projecting Sen. Prof. Ike Ekweremmadu as the governorship flag bearer of the party in Enugu state in order to reposition the state on the path that leads to fortune, instead of taking the state backwards.Sen. Prof. Ike Ekweremmadu’s credibility is not in doubt; many have asked the question why he has chosen to run for governorship election instead of gunning for the position of the president of Federal Republic of Nigeria after holding higher ranking positions in the past? His answer remains that it’s time to stay close to his people at home, take better care of their needs, industrialize and make the state more attractive for other Nigerians and foreign investors.By:Rex Kalu.",Pdp Party Delegates In Enugu Urged Not To Be Intimidated

333,"...says it was sponsored by Amosun, backs governor for second termAs the APC begins screening of political aspirants, the Ogun State Chapter of the Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC), has reacted to a petition sent to the National Chairman of the All Progressive Party (APC), Senator Adullahi Adamu, by one Ayodele Oludiran, which called for the disqualification of Governor Dapo Abiodun from contesting the 2023 election. The group, while describing the petition as spurious and worthless, urged Adamu and the APC leadership to ignore such petition, saying this is a political season where all manner of strategies would be deployed to nullify the candidacy of leading political figures.Some loyalists of Governor Abiodun had earlier alleged that the so-called Oludiran, is being sponsored by the immediate past governor of the state, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, who was said to have bankrolled the hatchet job. Speaking at a press conference in Abeokuta, the State's IPAC Chairman, Comrade Samson Okusanya, accused Amosun and some political gladiators of sponsoring Oludiran to blackmail and malign the governor, in an attempt to stop him from contesting for second term. Okusanya urged the national leadership of the APC to disregard the ""rantings of the drowning politicians and power maniacs"".Urging the APC to jettison the petition, IPAC said that the council is ready to resist any attempt by the former governor and his cohorts to disqualify Abiodun’s second term bid.The IPAC’s chairman also explained that the group will not allow itself to be part of any plan by Amosun to disqualify Abiodun from contesting the 2023 polls. Calling on Ogun people to support Abiodun for another tenure, the IPAC leadership insisted that Abiodun has completed many projects abandoned by Amosun and he is still putting in place, laudable projects in the state.The letter to the APC reads: ""Our attention has been drawn to the petition written and signed by one Ayodele Oludiran on behalf of a group seeking the disqualification of Prince Dapo Abiodun MFR, the Executive Governor of Ogun State. To our consternation, we found out that the petition is spurious, not genuine and a calculated attempt to disparage the person of the Governor.“Your Excellency Sir, with the petitioner ranting all through his epistle, it is made clear that Ayodele Oludiran, substantially lacks the capacity to correctly understand the complexities in rational thinking, needed to be a responsible public commentator. We also discovered that the very long, but embarrassingly empty epistle of calumny, written by said  Ayodele Oludiran, has definitely marked him out as a very worthless addition to the human race.“We urge the National leadership of the ruling Party to disregard the rantings of the drowning politicians and power maniacs, by jettisoning the petition as it’s an attempt to make the state ungovernable by the former Governor and ultimately, turn Ogun State to a war zone because his 8 years were wasted administration, which was characterised by looting and award of contract to pseudo contractors, diversion of bail out fund has become a thing of the past under the transparent administration of Prince Dapo Abiodun.“Definitely, the fifth columnist, who are hiding behind their fingers to truncate the development of Ogun State through all means including the latest attempt through the spurious petition shall be put to shame.These set of people who has  mismanaged the resources of the State, while at the helms of affairs (2011 to 2019) in the State through so many fraudulent white elephant projects are today the mantrach/ Epitome of “We shall do all things plunged the State into huge debts. “A tour round the State, to the sites of the abandoned Model Colleges where a whooping N52 billion was wasted by the immediate past Governor, vividly showed that posterity will judge him and his Government accordingly and even they ought to cover their eyes in shame because all abandoned, but fully paid road projects by their own administration has now been completed.“The former Governor and his group, sponsoring the faceless Ayodele Oludiran, are boasting round the State that they will malign, scandalise and blackmail Governor Dapo Abiodun, but the era of recycled political racketeers, who are strictly merchants without commitment and conscience for the Governed must be collectively brought to a final stop through a positive change as represented by His Excellency, Governor Dapo Abiodun MFR performance”.",2023: Ogun IPAC Urges APC To Ignore Petition Against Abiodun

We are setting up an international advisory board of ECAM Council and Dr. Ghribi would be delighted to welcome him on board.”It noted that the Council was “founded with the purpose of developing realistic, effective and long-lasting solutions for more sustainable healthcare systems, with a special focus on the common issues affecting the Southern hemisphere of the globe.”[/b]Dr. Jonathan will be attending this year’s ECAM Council’s high-level advisory board meeting holding in Italy on 30th May.[b]Every year in Italy, ECAM Council hosts a summit, in cooperation with The European House – Ambrosetti.

340,"2023 Presidency: Security, Economy Restructuring Will Be My Focus, Tambuwal Tells Forum of Ex-PDP NWCLeading presidential aspirant and Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, has reiterated that security and the economy will be his main focus area should he emerge as the flag bearer of the People’s Democratic Party [PDP] and subsequently President of Nigeria. Mr Tambuwal gave this indication yesterday in Abuja, in continuation of his engagements with stakeholders and delegates of the People’s Democratic Party [PDP] when he met the forum of the former National Working Committee of PDP who are delegates at the May 28 convention. He was accompanied by Senator Tunde Ogbeha, Former governor of Sokoto Attahiru Bafrawa as well as Deputy Governor of Zamfara state, Mahadi Aliu Gusau. Speaking on the issue of insecurity in Nigeria, Governor Tambuwal said he would personally present a bill for the creation of state police to the National Assembly. “The main reason why we have so much insecurity is lack of political will. If you say you need the approval of the US government to buy certain ammunition, do you also need their approval to recruit more men into the police, Army and other security agencies?  Do we also need US approval to train and retrain our security men?“What is the firepower of the bandits and other terrorists? In the absence of these sophisticated weapons, can’t we get the AK 47 and other not so sophisticated weapons? “We must also address the root cause of insecurity like jobs, marginalisation and the rest. If we address marginalisation, we won’t have the issues we have in the South-East. How can there not be someone from the South-East in the 8 top positions of this country? Under my watch, that cannot happen. I had done it before as Speaker of the House of Reps where all zones were considered when we constituted committees. My colleagues are still alive; you can ask them.Speaking on the economy, the former speaker said the current administration of President Buhari has rubbished whatever gain the PDP government made in the last 16 years adding that he would pay constant attention to the economy.“We have done it before. We have the best hands in PDP to manage our economy. Not people who want to run for office and also manage our economy,” he said. Similarly, on restructuring, Governor Tambuwal noted the idea of restructuring differs but stressed that what Nigerians want is inclusive and participatory government. “Restructuring means different things to different leaders. For example, the appointments commissioners for RMAFC, Civil Service Commission, Federal Character, and Population commissioner should be done by the state and screened by the state House of Assembly with the power of recall. That is restructuring. “State police is restructuring. But I don’t think it’s possible for Nigeria, at this time, to go back to the regional government. Therefore, we must pick the issues one by one to fix them to suit what Mr A sees as restructuring, What B sees as restructuring. and what C as restructuring.”Tambuwal who also doubles as the chairman of the PDP Governors’ Forum promised the Forum of EX- NWC members that he would not abandon party men who will work for the victory of the party at the poll and run after technocrats noting that “We are all technocrats here. We have gone to the best of schools and excelled in our various fields. I as president will appoint people from within the PDP”. Speaking on behalf of the members of the Ex-NWC forum, the Chairperson, Kema Chikwe, described governor Tambuwal as a leader who is ready to speak on issues and a truly detribalized Nigeria who for the past 8 or more years has been spending the Christmas holiday in the South East. Other members of the Forum present at the consultative meeting include Adamu Mu'azu former PDP national chairman, Kola Ologbondiyan, Senator Ben Obi, Jude Okoye, Olisa Metuh, Abdullahi MaiBasira, Eddy Olafeso, amongst others. Equally, Hon. Abdul Ningi, who described himself as an Atiku Abubakar man but noted that Tambuwal is one leader who can rebuild Nigeria and return PDP to power.https://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/05/2023-presidency-security-economy-restructuring-ll-be-my-focus-tambuwal/amp/","2023 Presidency: Security, Economy Restructuring Will Be My Focus - Tambuwal"

According to Twitter users, Deborah had shared a voice note on her class Whatsapp group in which she challenged her colleagues who were posting religious information there. She spoke in Hausa, however, according to a Twitter user who did the translation, Deborah was quoted to have said;""Holy Ghost Fire, nothing's going to happen to me, you should know what to be sending to this group, it's not that the group was created to be sending nonsense, the group was created for posting things like, test assignment e.t.c. not the nonsense you are posting, no be only prophet, you are coming to play on me."" The nonsense she referred to is the religious posts.""Her comments were said to have irked some of her colleagues who felt she disrespected Prophet Mohammed, and threatened to deal with her.

BusinessDay was a cooperation partner in the research.Covering the period between 2017 and 2020, while taking the COVID-19 pandemic into consideration and highlighting the companies that successfully adapted to the resultant challenges, the FT’s ranking showed Nigeria has the second-highest number of successful companies after South Africa with 24 companies. Kenya came third with nine companies.According to the FT, the countries with the highest representations are also the markets that have attracted the most venture capital and where unicorns (companies valued at $1 billion+) and would-be unicorns have proliferated.The successful companies were ranked based on their compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in revenue between 2017 and 2020, as demanded by the FT and research company Statista.The criteria included that the revenue generated by the firm must be at least $100,000 in 2017, revenue of at least $1.5 million in 2020 which must be organic, the company must be headquartered in one of the African countries, and it is not a subsidiary or branch office of any kind.The successful Nigerian companies are AFEX Commodities Exchange, Zedcrest Group, Starsight Energy, Kawai Technologies, West African Soy Industries Limited, Commercio Partners, Northern Nigerian Flour Mills (NNFM), Alpha Morgan Capital Managers, WACOT Rice, Field Intelligence, and Tripple Gee & Company.Others are FoodCo Nigeria, Global Accelerex, Prestige Assurance, Julius Berger Nigeria, Genesis Food Nigeria, Courteville Business Solutions, RT Briscoe Nigeria, Mutual Benefits Assurance, United Capital and HIS Netherlands Holdco BV.Six of the successful Nigerian companies are listed on the Nigerian Exchange Limited.“It is a significant accomplishment and recognises the work we have been doing over the past eight years. Although the global pandemic has proved challenging over the past two years, we’ve worked extremely hard to improve Africa’s commodity market,” Ayodeji Balogun, CEO at AFEX Commodities, said.Further findings showed AFEX Commodities topped the Nigerian list, posting 4,289.7 percent average growth between 2017 and 2020, and ranked third in Africa. Zedcrest Group, a firm whose growth has been spurred by innovation in the nation’s financial services, was ranked second in Nigeria and fifth in Africa with 1,481.7 percent growth.“It’s an honour to be ranked on the inaugural FT Africa’s Fastest-Growing Companies list,” said Adedayo Amzat, Group Managing Director at Zedcrest Group. “It is a direct reflection of the leadership team we have in place, and I couldn’t be more proud of our team. We’ve been fortunate to extend our business across different verticals of the financial sector over the past few years and we’ll continue to evaluate opportunities in other markets as part of our future growth strategy.”He reaffirmed the company’s commitment to building inter-connected financial solutions across Africa through technological innovation while ensuring global best practices.Starsight Energy posted 1,154.4 percent growth to be ranked sixth in Africa. It was followed by Kawai Technologies, which recorded 535.6 percent growth during the period. West African Soy Industries, a firm in the nation’s agricultural sector, recorded 507.6 percent growth.Commercio Partners, NNFM, Alpha Morgan, WACOT Rice, Field Intelligence, Tripple Gee and Co. all recorded revenue growth of between 170.1 percent and 232.3 percent. HIS Netherlands Holdco BV, FoodCo Nigeria, Global Accelerex, and Prestige Assurance posted growth of between 80 percent and 160 percent.Nigeria’s construction giant, Julius Berger, grew its revenue during the period by 70.3 percent. Genesis Food, 54 percent; Courtville, 50.8 percent; Briscoe, 48 percent; Mutual Benefits, 45.4 percent, and United Capital, 44.3 percent.Some companies are missing from the list, the British paper says, for reasons that include private companies refusing to disclose their revenue figures. The survey required a chief executive or similar senior figure to certify revenue numbers.Announcing the list of the successful African companies, FT said: “From digitising informal trade to fintech and mining, the inaugural list reflects trends on the continent.”It said following the application phase, Statista examined the officially stated revenue data of about 900 companies in Africa, adding that high-profile companies that met the criteria for inclusion were added to the list.It said the data were collected through research using official sources, such as publicly available earning presentations, investor relations websites, or annual reports.According to the FT, the inaugural annual ranking of Africa’s fastest-growing companies provides a snapshot of the corporate landscape in a continent where technology and support-service businesses have had to adapt to a radically altered environment.It said chief among the recent challenges had been operating within the tough restrictions introduced by many African governments to combat COVID-19.It said: “In the end, outside of South Africa and parts of north Africa, the health impact has been less severe than many feared. But the economic consequences of lockdown-especially in crowded urban settings where many lived hand to mouth-have been devastating.“Many of the fastest-growing companies, especially in the fintech sector, are those seeking to tap Africa’s unbanked population, or markets that have previously been underserved or ignored. The health and education sectors, for example, spurred by unmet need and rising aspirations, are among those offering most scope for growth.”",Nigeria Shines As FT Unveils Africa’s Fastest-growing Firms

350,"Prof Odinkalu is a former Chairman of National Human Rights Commission and currently the senior legal officer for Africa, Open Society Justice Initiative.The Conference which is scheduled to hold from May 22-26, 2022 has the theme “Rule of Law and Democratic Evolution in Nigeria”.https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=430889349039744&id=100063560468956(SPIDEL Chairman, Monday Ubani's reaction to Deborah's murder);Personal Statement by Chidi Anselm Odinkalu Concerning the Proposed SPIDEL Conference in SokotoGood morning,1. I am gratified that the Chairman of SPIDEL, my brother, Monday Ubani, MoU, has responded to this horrific incident in Sokoto. Sadly, much of the contents of his statement is beside the point at best. Other parts are gratuitously insulting. It seems clear his statement is more focused on saving a conference, which can take place anywhere, or on NBA politics, which is unending rather than on valorising human life and responsible government. The issues here are clear & his statement fails to reckon with any of them at all. That is why I consider it necessary to respond.2. To begin with, if his comparison with Owerri & Imo State was meant to make any point, it fails. I would oppose the scheduling of any such conference by the NBA or any of its organs in Imo State right now without thinking twice about it and with a clear conscience. That part of his statement I found both cheap & self defeating.3. So, MoU sent an sms to the state governor – who, by the way, was characteristically out of the state when this happened & did not see fit to return immediately. And he says that the state government did not do the killing, as if anyone said it did. That is worse than setting up a proverbial straw-man in order to demolish it. 4. If all that MoU has done is send sms to the state governor & HAG, he sadly fails to get the point about this. You mean, all that bloviating evident on the face of his statement was done in order to convey the point that he has sent a mere SMS to the state governor?! And on the back of that he accuses colleagues of lacking “locus” whatever that means.5. The reality is life has lost meaning in Nigeria. SPIDEL was set up to defend the meaning of human life in Nigeria. I know because I did. In case my brother does not recall, the guarantor of life under our constitution is not the state governor. It is the president. I may have missed it but I am yet to see what the President or Federal Govt has said about this incident. Nor has MoU said that he sent an sms to the President or to Abubakar Malami, since, in his view, an SMS is all that this incident requires. But an SMS addressed to the wrong recipient is not an SMS at all.6. We do not need to be lawyers going to a conference in Sokoto to care about pre-Neanderthal killings of Nigerians anywhere in Nigeria. His line about people lacking locus is a gratuitous insult to a traumatised people.7. I was prepared to suspend final decision on participating in Sokoto until I heard from the leadership of SPIDEL. Having now heard from them, it is clear to me that they do not get the significance of this issue. I am now convinced that I will be unable to accept an invite to participate in the SPIDEL conference.8. So, I, Chidi Anselm Odinkalu, am cancelling my participation. I will, in addition, actively campaign against the meeting. Everyone has to take their own decision. The SPIDEL leadership has taken its decision. I have taken mine. This is a matter of conscience.I am City-Zen Chidi. This is my stand.https://barristerng.com/deborah-samuel-prof-odinkalu-cancels-participation-in-sokoto-spidel-conference-over-stoning-of-student-for-blasphemy/",Deborah Samuel: Prof Odinkalu Cancels Participation In Sokoto SPIDEL Conference
351,"As the nation approached another presidential election, it is clear that powers should return to the South after 8 years of the Buhari administration. The Southern Governors from both parties have agreed that power should go South and a few of them have indicated interest in contesting including Dave Umahi, Kayode Fayemi, Udom Emmanuel, Ben Ayade and Nyesom Wike.The body language in the APC has always been that power MUST return to the South, however, the PDP has always indicated the presidency will be thrown open. However of late we have seen the emergence of Senate President Ahmed Lawan as a candidate and his two biggest sponsors are Orji Uzo Kalu and Hope Uzodinma Uzodinma is a Southern governor of igbo extraction who stood with his southern colleagues to demand for a Southern president; how then is he the person spear heading the call for a northern president, especially when Dave Umahi is in the race? Ben Ayade is also in the race. Is this a case of ""if we Igbos cannot get it then it should remain in the North"" or is it a case of ""if I cannot get it, then no other Igbo or Southerner should get it"". Orji Uzo Kalu already insinuated that was his reason. The same is being witnessed in the PDP. Wike, Peter Obi  Pius Anyim, Udom Emmanuel and a few others are contesting from the South. Peter Obi seems to be the most popular candidate from the South East but he does not have the deep pockets or national appeal of the Northern aspirants, so there are obstacles before him. However, you will.also realise that the two Igbo PDP Governors - Ugwuanyi and Ikpeazu are supporting Atiku and Wike respectively.  None of them is with Peter Obi or Pius Anyim. This MUST be a case of ""if I cant become president, then no other Igbo man shoulf""  I wonder why blithering hovernor is supporting Peter Obi because Obi actually has a slim chance of getting the PDP ticket. And to the supporters of Peter Obi, they have threatened to dump the PDP if Obi does not get the ticket... but can they really do that? What will be the alternative for Obi supporters when he loses. Will they hope for the VP slot from Atiku or will they just lose interest. Please note that it is too late for a third force and the APC ticket will certainly not go to the South East.",Igbos Supporting Ahmed Lawan And The Politics With Bitterness

357,"Over 1500 Peoples Democratic Party delegates attended former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki’s official declaration for president today in Abuja.At a Breakfast and Media Session titled, “Why I Am Running for President”, organised by Saraki Support Group in Abuja, the former Senate President said if elected, he will be President for all, and will represent a Nigerian identity that is truly diverse, inclusive, and truly Nigerian.He also stated that he will be the bridge between the young and the old.Saraki said he will also be the bridge between the private sector and the public sector. “I will be the bridge between Muslims and Christians. I will be the bridge between the North and the South. because I am the Nigerian for all Nigerians,” he added.Although he acknowledged the great efforts of all past leaders over the years, he, however, said as long as there is a child in Nigeria that cannot read or write, then the job is not done. “And it is for this one child that I want to run for President because I will ensure that the law on compulsory basic education is enforced and quality of teaching improves in all public schools,” he said.He acknowledged that the nation has experienced setbacks in the last couple of years that no one could have imagined possible only less than a decade ago, he said 2023, therefore, presents a great moment of decision for Nigerians.“2023 presents the moment to choose hope over hopelessness; the moment to choose peace and security over fear and terror; the moment to choose unity and inclusion over division and exclusion; the moment that we draw a bold line in the sands of history and say, ‘no more’ and then move ahead as one people, as one nation, towards our God-assigned destiny as the greatest black nation on the face of the earth,” he added.On his part, the chairman, Saraki Campaign Council, Prof. Iyorwuese Hagher, described the immediate-past Senate President as “a real change maker”, saying if elected as President in 2023, he will restore stability in Nigeria.Hagher said Saraki will “give Nigerians, not the change from the top to the bottom, but the real change we wanted in 2015 to live in peace, pursue life, liberty, and happiness and be guaranteed security, prosperity and good health.”He further noted that Saraki is loaded with political capital as a man who has integrity, courage, and the love of Nigeria. Hagher said his integrity was a reason why coalitions of party men and women were supporting him.He explained that the Bukola Saraki Campaign for the Presidency symbolises the age and social movement when Nigerians have been gravely disappointed with politicians who were elected because of where they were born, the language they spoke, and the way and what they worshiped.Speaking further, he said: “In Bukola you are witnessing a social movement in Nigeria when, (I paraphrase Dr. Luther King Jr.) ‘Nigerians are ready to elect their President, Judged by the content of his/her political achievements and vision and not by his tribal origin, what language he speaks, and his faiths.'”He further noted that in the past three months Saraki has been in 36 States of Nigeria either in person or through his Campaign Council to declare his intention to contest for the elective position of President and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. “His declaration in all the 36 States of Nigeria was well received and the PDP Members and the Nigerian citizens are already in a frenzy to see him win the Primaries to become the flag-bearer of his party the PDP,” he added.https://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/05/2023-presidency-over-1500-pdp-delegates-attend-sarakis-declaration/",2023 Presidency: Over 1500 PDP Delegates Attend Saraki’s Declaration (Pictures)

May the recklessness of our tongues never drive us to (an) early grave.” Ms Samuel, a 200-level Home-Economics student accused of blasphemy, had expressed her displeasure with the flood of religious broadcast messages shared on her department's WhatsApp page.The deceased reminded her coursemates in a WhatsApp voice note that the group was created solely for academic purposes, such as sharing important information about tests, assignments, deadlines, examinations, and the like.“Holy ghost fire, nothing would happen to me. Is it by force you guys keep sending these religious messages in our group? Our group wasn’t created for that, but rather as a notice for when there’s a test, assignment, examinations, etc. Not these nonsense religious posts,” voiced Ms Samuel on her department’s WhatsApp group and heard by Peoples Gazette.The voice message infuriated fanatical coursemates and schoolmates who found her remark offensive to their Islamic beliefs.Ms Deborah was surrounded at the school's security post by enraged students who pelted her with sticks and stones until she died.According to a student who witnessed the incident and reported it to The Gazette, her dying body was roasted alongside the building where she sought refuge.",More Christians Will Be Executed For Insulting Prophet Muhammad- Tambuwal Aide
360,"MURIC Condemns Killing of Debrah Samuel over alleged BlasphemyThe Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has condemned the killing in Sokoto of a student, Deborah Samuel, over allegation of blasphemy.In a statement released by its director, Professor Ishaq Akintola, on Friday, 13th May, 2022, MURIC described the killing as outrageous, illegal and unlawful.The full statement reads :“A female student of the Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto, Deborah Samuel, was on Thursday killed for allegedly blaspheming against the Prophet Muhammad (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The blaspheme statement was reportedly posted on a whatshap group. She was asked to withdraw the statement but she allegedly refused to do so. The school’s security unit and police were overwhelmed by the crowd when they tried to rescue her.“MURIC strongly condemns this killing and all others that have been happening in Nigeria in recent times. Those aggrieved by the student’s post should have reported her to the security agencies or to the Shariah police, the hizbah. Mob killing is archaic and bohemian. It belongs to the Stone Age. Nobody has the right to take the law into his hands.“The Glorious Qur’an compares the killing of a single person to the killing of the whole of humanity just as it compares the saving of a life to the rescue of all homo sapiens (Qur’an 5:32) In like manner, Prophet Muhammad (SAW) himself condemned all acts of violence and advocated peaceful conduct at all times.“But this incident should not be condemned in isolation. The recent trend whereby Nigerians now freely shed their brothers blood should be condemned by all patriots. In this regard, we also strongly denounce the killing of several Northern Muslims in the South East in the past few months.“We frown at the recent burning last week of a truck fully loaded with cows in the South East as well as the killing of many Muslims of South East origin by their Igbo brothers in the same South East. We note with keen interest that Muslims in the North did not retaliate when these killings were taking place.“MURIC calls on the Sokoto Police Command to do everything within its power to get to the bottom of the yesterday’s killing of the female student over alleged blasphemy. We appeal to members of the public to remain calm and law abiding. Nigerians should allow the police to carry out its investigations on the case. The Sokoto Police Command has started well as it already has two suspects in detention for the killing.“Meanwhile we remind Nigerians to always exercise restraint on matters of religion. Free speech is no longer free if it amounts to religious provocation. Even the European Court has ruled that the utterance of derisive statements against the prophet of any religion is a crime.“We affirm clearly, categorically and unequivocally that there is a symbiotic relationship between provocation, violence and extremism. While MURIC will not condone extremism and violence, the anatomy of terrorism is becoming clearer day by day. We must all ponder over the causal-effect theory. Violence and terrorism are mere symptoms. The real disease is provocation. Violence and terrorism are mere smoke. Provocation is the fire and we all know that there is no smoke without fire.“We therefore appeal to Nigerians to desist from insulting, deriding or abusing the prophets of other religions. Muslims should continue to respect Jesus (peace be upon him) whom the Christians hold very dear. In the same vein, Christians should avoid casting aspersion on the person of Prophet Muhammad (SAW). We have experienced enough religious crisis in the land.Mynd44 LalasticlalaThis is the original text not the doctored one by Cyynthia / Yobabad",Original Text: MURIC Condemns Killing Of Debrah Samuel Over Alleged Blasphemy

You heard me, I said there is no news but there will be news.”But when told that Nigerians were anxious about his position, he said: “Let them have heart attack. It’s good to have heart attack. I am having a lot of fun.”The governor of the apex bank has been under intense pressure since expression of interest and nomination forms of the ruling APC were picked on his behalf, triggering outrage as many called on him to step down.Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State, who described Emefiele’s interest in the 2023 Presidency as “a joke taken too far”, had asked Buhari to fire him if he refused to step down.But in a series of tweets after the development, Emefiele declined the presidential forms bought for him, saying he would use his resources to purchase them if he is interested in the race.He said God would decide for him “in the next few days”.But early this week, another twist was added to the development as a suit was filed before a Federal High Court in Abuja over the alleged plan to disqualify him from the 2023 presidential primaries slated for the end of this month.The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has given political parties a deadline of June 3 to submit their candidates for the 2023 elections.Some lawyers had argued that Emefiele was unfit to run going by Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act.The section states that no political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the Convention or Congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.But in documents seen by Daily Trust, Emefiele, through his lawyer, Mike Ozekhome, argued that he is not a political appointee and by provision of the constitution, he is expected to resign a month before the February 25, 2023, presidential election.He also contended that a Federal High Court in Umuahia, Abia State, had nullified section 12 ( of the Electoral Act.INEC and the Office of the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) were joined in the suit.Buhari had on Wednesday ordered the resignation of political appointees seeking to contest the 2023 elections.The CBN governor was copied in the circular titled, ‘Ministers, heads of government agencies, ambassadors and other appointees with political ambitions to resign’.On Wednesday, three of the nine ministers seeking to contest the 2023 elections quit the cabinet.https://dailytrust.com/breaking-nigerians-can-have-heart-attack-im-having-fun-emefiele","Emefiele: Nigerians Can Have Heart Attack, I’m Having Fun"

369," Ahead of the 2023 general election, former lawmaker, Shehu Sani, on Wednesday, advised the Independent National Electoral Commission to keep its sensitive materials for the exercise with pastors and an Islamic human rights group, Muslim Rights Concern.The PUNCH reports that the Nigerian Bar Association and civil rights groups on Mondaywarned that the Central Bank of Nigeria Governor, Godwin Emefiele’s involvement in partisan politics was threatening the 2023 elections. They also said Emefiele’s membership of the ruling All Progressives Congress had eroded the credibility, of the apex bank, where sensitive materials are kept, during elections. Prominent Nigerians who spoke separately to The PUNCH condemned Emefiele’s APC membership and his failure to resign while allegedly plottingto contest the 2023 presidency. But INEC in a statement by Rotimi Oyekanmi, the Chief Press Secretary to its Chairman, said it had taken notice of the latest revelation on Emefiele. It added that it might move ballot papers from the CBN vaults. “The strategic partnership between the Central Bank of Nigeria and the Independent National Electoral Commission which enables the commission to store its sensitive election materials with the CBN, has been in place for many years and beneficial in several ways. “Indeed, there have been various reports that the CBN governor is nursing an intention to run for the office of President. But, he has yet to formally declare his intention to run for the office of president as of today. “However, if and when he eventually does, the commission will look at the implications and take a decision on what becomes of the long-standing strategic partnership with the CBN,” the statement read. However, reacting to the development on Wednesday, Sani who represented Kaduna Central in the 8th Senate, said the electoral umpire should entrust the ballot papers to the care of “God-fearing” individuals.In a tweet on his Twitter page, Sani wrote, “INEC materials should be given to the God fearing MURIC and Pastors for safe keeping.” https://punchng.com/keep-sensitive-materials-with-muric-pastors-shehu-sani-advises-inec/","2023: INEC, Keep Sensitive Materials With Pastors And the Muric - Shehu Sani"

But, unlike Tinubu, he has proved incapable of surrounding himself with the best and brightest.” The lawyer noted that Osinbajo’s appointees for key federal positions have been mostly mediocre.“He has deprived himself of strong testimony for the No. 1 job because none of his proxies – in BPE, in NDDC, or in FIRS performed very well. There is also some whirl of corruption around them.” Amadi also said the Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) does not look like one who will shut down the rentier economy.“He looks like someone who will continue governance as patronage, arguably with a dose of parochialism.”Amadi added that though Osinbajo is far cleaner than Tinubu, more respectable and intelligent, he is “not a great choice for 2023”.

What they should name the country Frank Opigo suggested Biafra as the name of the country because by then all the ocean areas of Ijaw was known as Bight of Biafra and Ojukwu say he loved the name and the name was adopted.Another Ijaw created the Biafran National Anthem.Half Ijaws were under Western Region half was in Eastern Region.Ijaws weren't minorities even in Eastern region the problem was they were not as united as they are today and as the Regional capital was in IBO land the Igbo's were using it in ways other tribes don't like.Ijaw elders in the then Eastern Region told the youths never ever to believe in Biafra because they did bad things to Ijaw back then and to an average Ijaw, Boro was a God in human form even till today.Now that Ijaws are not going with Biafra and the two apex Ijaw sociocultural organizations the Ijaw National Congress INC and the Lovers of Ijaw Nation Organization LINO have come out and say Ijaws are for Ijaw Republic or nothing else and as we speak they've taken it to the United Nations and have suit asking for referendum for Ijaw in Abuja Court.Before Biafra was declaredBoro an Ijaw, declared Republic So Ijaws are holding to this because Nigeria have taught everybody sense and Ijaw reject another mini Nigeria.Ijaw produces over 90 percent of all Nigeria's crude oil but were unjustly balkanized into six States.Since all Ijaw areas unjustly balkanized into six States of which are Ondo, Edo, Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers and Akwa-Ibom States share perfect boundaries with each other and are fully together so the Ijaw Nation leadership chose a country for Ijaws alone.The Question is Then why is Igbo still using the Biafra name and the Biafra National Anthem created and giving by Ijaws When Ijaws won't follow them to Biafra.",Biafra!!!

We have what it takes to end banditry and killings"", he said.He added that he wants a Nigeria where quality education for children is guaranteed, jobs created and a vibrant economy.The APC National Leader maintains that his track records which includes creation of the Lagos State masterplan, rebranding Lagos economy and building of human capacity have attests that he is  the best to lead the Nation.Asiwaju Tinubu further disclosed that he is not distracted with all that is being said about his health  knowing  that he is fit and has the intellectual capacity.The former Lagos State Governor thanked  Governor Abubakar Sani Bello, Niger State APC chairman, Alh Haliru Zakari Jakantoro for mobilizing the delegates to receive him.Governor Sani Bello in his remarks, commended Senator Tinubu for his giant strides in transforming Lagos State.He assured that their will be no imposition on the delegates as they will be allowed to vote for whoever they so wish.Earlier, former Governor of Borno State, Kashim Shettima commended Niger State for adhering to power sharing formular in the State.Shettima described Governor Sani Bello as a man of peace, Justice, fairness and equity, pointing out that the Governor exemplified such attributes before and during the National Convention of the Party. Shettima said Members of APC and Nigerians owe Tinubu gratitude considering his immense contributions in the formation, growth and development of the party in particular and the Nation by extention, noting that Tinubu understands modern economy.The APC presidential aspiran also observed Friday Juma'at prayer at the Government House Juma'at Mosque shortly after his arrival.Mary Noel-Berje Chief Press Secretary to the Governor of Niger State.",Nigeria Needs An Intellectual As President Says Tinubu

""For the 16 years that the PDP governed Nigeria, from 1999 to 2015, we instituted purposeful governance and set the stage for meaningful and sustainable development in our country. Beginning from the presidency of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, we stabilized the polity, steered it away from further military incursions and established relevant institutions to set the pace for significant and impactful development."" He stated further that "" I fought insurgency, the worst security challenge in the history of the nation except the civil war. Even with that, we professionally managed and grew our economy to become the largest economy in Africa with a GDP of over $500 billion."" The next statement said ""That was the economy we handed over to the Buhari administration."" The nail is further driven in by the following statements "" I recall that the opposition and their sympathisers and campaigners, local and international, with their malicious propaganda, tore our economy to shreds, threatened our stability and existence as a nation and intimidated our citizens, all in the bid to take over power."" He continued"" The narrative of inheriting empty treasury is a blatant lie. Also, the excuse of the collapse of world crude oil prices does not hold water. This is because the Fourth Republic took off in 1999 with crude oil selling for less than $20 per barrel and GDP growth rate at 0.58%, according to National Bureau of Statistics figures. Yet the economy maintained a steady growth from that year, peaking at 15.33% in 2002 when the average crude oil price was about $25.""

The President has reacted to this, a statement which was issued earlier condemning the action.  I must say that it's a deeply distressing thing, very disturbing - such an attrocious killing of the young lady by a mob who took the law into their own hands. I think it's very unfortunate. The swift reaction of the Sokoto State Government and also the Sultan of Sokoto is highly commendable. I think that their swift reaction to the situation clearly demonstrated the outrage of millions of Nigerians and also demonstrated the desire of everyone to ensure that the perpetrators are quickly apprehended and prosecuted. As the President said, there’s really no excuse for anyone to take the law into their own hands no matter the provocation, there are set processes for ensuring that we are able to redress whatever wrongs that are done against us.We must express our condolence to the family of the young lady Deborah Samuel. I can't imagine how her parents and siblings and members of her family feel, not just about her death, but the very horrendous nature of its occurrence.

The refinery located in Ikot Akpan Okop, Mkpat Enin Local Government, Akwa Ibom State is a multi value chain mechanism that will not only diversify production but also triple returns on investment, the Governor, Mr Udom Emmanuel has declared.The inauguration of the St. Gabriel Coconut Oil Factory which took place on Friday, was performed by Senator Gabriel Suswan, former Governor of Benue State.Speaking at the event, Governor Emmanuel said the landmark project which is the first of its kind in Africa is a combination of Asia and European technology built to transfer skills and develop the youths, and will earn the state high revenue as virgin coconut oil costs higher in the international market than crude oil. He noted with delight that the coconut oil factory which will be a major foreign exchange earner is expected to create employment for the teeming youths, and will diversify the economy of the state.Hear him, “Today you are going to witness the first of its kind, you cannot find this kind of factory in Africa that is refining virgin coconut oil with the capacity to process one million nuts a day in three shifts.""""Today we are aware that in the international market virgin crude coconut oil goes for $6 per liter and 221 liters makes one barrel and if the much talked about crude oil is about $110 per barrel it means that virgin coconut oil is $1326 per barrel which is higher than crude oil.

397,"‘You’ve lost our votes’, Nigerians tell Atiku for deleting post condemning lynching of student in SokotoMany Nigerian Twitter users have taken a swipe against former Vice President Atiku Abubakar for changing his stance on the killing of a female student in Sokoto State.On Thursday, a group of students of Shehu Shagari College of Education in Sokoto had murdered their female coursemate over alleged blasphemy.The school has since been shut down by the state government, while police had since arrested some of the suspects.Reacting to the killing, Mr Atiku took to his verified Facebook page to condemn the lynching of the female student named Deborah Yakubu.The now deleted post read: “There cannot be a justification for such gruesome murder. Deborah Yakubu was murdered and all those behind her death must be brought to book to justice.“My condolence to her family and friends.”A few minutes after the post, the former vice-president deleted the post, following a backlash against his stance.Mr Atiku, however, said the post does agree with his orders, claiming that the post was done by his staff without his input.Trolling the former vice-president, a former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, said Mr Atiku’s refusal to condemn the killing of Deborah & the withdrawal of an earlier condemnation is worse than the killing itself.“By this @Atiku  has murdered Deborah all over again & pissed on her grave. He has also encouraged other sociopaths to come out & commit murder with impunity,” Mr Fani-Kayode wrote.One of the Twitter users, @mrmacaronii also said: “Atiku deleting the tweet condemning the gruesome murder of Deborah shows what we have been preaching this whole election season. Politicians don’t care for the people. They only play to the gallery when seeking for our votes. The people must see beyond these gimmicks…”Another user, @Morris_Monye, said: “Atiku was not really sympathetic Tried to appease the South, saw reaction from the North, deleted He feels it’s better not to offend the North than offend the South because Southerners are slaves and will vote for him anyways Our Politicians are the wickedest people on earth.”Wondering why Mr Atiku deleted the post, For @TheFavoredWoman, said: “Why did @atiku delete this tweet? Did you change your mind about justice for Deborah? Did you change your mind about offering your condolences? Is it that you have now found justification for the gruesome murder?For @simon_ekpa, the death & killing Deborah has exposed the dangerous diversity in Nigeria.“It has exposed @atiku exposed @ShehuSani and many more Muslims. I have said it, no real activists from the North. Nigeria is already divided, the only thing that bring The south & north together is corruption,” Mr Ekpa wrote.Shehu Gazali sadiq said: “Atiku Abubakar deleted his tweet condemning the murder of Deborah In Sokoto because Muslims are threatening not to vote for him. His ambition is more important than human life. A vote for Atiku is a vote for islamists.

402,"Ahead of the primaries of the two leading political parties, the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), aspirants are mopping up dollars across the country, leading to the further depreciation of the naira.Daily Trust reports that the dollar has hovered between N550 to N570 in the last two months before it jumped to an all-time high of N595 at the black market on Thursday.The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) does not however recognise the black market rate, which is far above the N415/$ official rate.Findings by this newspaper showed that the naira has continued to depreciate at the parallel market against the dollar as many people scoop the scarce foreign currency.It was gathered that many commercial banks are running out of dollars as they are unable to meet many requests from customers. There are fears in some quarters that the exchange rate might climb to N600/$ as the scarcity persists.Politicians on the prowlThe rush by the aspirants to buy the foreign currency has added pressure on the naira, which has been on the slide for long.Through their agents, the BDC operators said politicians seeking elective offices have been moving around the country to buy the foreign currency, which sources said is much easier to use “to reach out to delegates” and other critical stakeholders instead of carrying big bags.The PDP has fixed its presidential primary for May 28-29, while that of the ruling APC would hold between May 30 and June 1.No fewer than 15 aspirants have been cleared to participate in the primary of the PDP while about 30 contenders have picked the forms for the presidential ticket of the APC.Daily Trust reports that in the last four weeks, aspirants in both the APC and PDP have been moving across the country to woo delegates and meet critical stakeholders of their parties.A total of 7,800 delegates will participate in the primary of the APC and 3,700 will determine the flag bearer of the PDP.Daily Trust reports that last week, one of the leading aspirants in the APC was said to have shared between $300 to $400 (N178,500 and N238,000) to delegates in two states in the North East geopolitical zone.A former governor told one of our reporters that a female head of a federal agency, who is at the forefront of promoting the governorship ambition of someone, has also been stockpiling the foreign currency.He said, “She is one of the major contributors to the scarcity of the USD. Whenever she orders for the currency, there would be an increase in the rate of the dollar because she buys in millions.”Our correspondents report that the trend was not limited to presidential aspirants, as people vying for the governorship, senatorial, House of Representatives and state house of assembly are doing the same.Aside from delegates, the aspirants have been reaching out to other stakeholders in the political terrain including traditional rulers, religious leaders, CSOs and security operatives, among others.Scarcity worsens in May – BDCsOn Thursday, one dollar was exchanged for N595 at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA) in Lagos and other parallel markets in the metropolis, especially Ikeja.Most bureau de change (BDC) operators say they buy the dollar at N585 and N590 and sell around N595.“When you go to any bank today, the highest you can probably get is $2000,” says a BDC operator, Nasiru, at Allen Avenue in Lagos.He said the apex bank is only making the dollars available to their “political allies.”In Abuja, the naira was exchanged for between N591 to N592/$1. Some of the BDC operators who spoke to our correspondent said the demand has spiked from April but got worse this month.When Daily Trust visited the popular Wapa BDC market in Kano, it was busy with people going about their normal businesses, but with no element of USD circulating among people.Speaking to our report, a BDC operator, who asked not to be named, said the dollar price has been rising in the past few days.“In the last one to two weeks, we sell the dollar at N585 to N587. But suddenly this week it rose to N591, so you can see the changes,” he said.Increased political demand causing scarcity – GwadabeSpeaking to our correspondent, the President of the Association of Bureaux De Change Operators of Nigeria (ABCON), Alhaji (Dr) Aminu Gwadabe, attributed the shading of naira value in the street market to increased political demand, especially with the huge competition for the presidency and other positions.“As of yesterday, it closed at N592/$1,” he said.“The naira has been depreciating since April. Of course, during political season, there is usually huge pressure on the naira because politicians share dollars, especially to delegates, key politicians and people of influence,” he said.Experts predict dark daysAn economist at the Lagos Business School (LBS), Dr Bongo Adi told our correspondent that the situation also happened in 2019 as politicians piled up dollars to pay delegates who mostly demand foreign currencies.“The delegates see that role as an opportunity to feather their nest,” he said.However, commenting on the issues, a political analyst, Dr Saidu Ahmad Dukawa of Bayero University, Kano (BUK), said the mop-up, if true, will go a long way in promoting money politics in the country and crippling the value of the naira, which will not produce good leadership in future.Also commenting, Professor Kamilu Sani Fage, a renowned political scientist, opined that if it was established to be true that politicians are the ones mopping up dollars from the forex market, it would portend a lot of problems for the political system.He said the outcome of such development would not augur well for not just the political system but the entire Nigerian system because, after the monetisation of the political system, Nigerians will not be able to get the right dividends of democracy in the governance period that follows.https://dailytrust.com/ahead-of-apc-pdp-primaries-naira-crashes-further-as-aspirants-mop-up-dollars","Ahead Of APC, PDP Primaries: Naira Crashes Further As Aspirants Mop Up Dollars"
403,"Many Nigerians are wondering the motivation behind the large number of aspirants eying the single seat.Reasons behind mad rushStakeholders and party chieftains in the polity have listed different reasons behind the massive entry by aspirants into the APC presidential race.Dr Kayode Fayemi, who is one of the presidential aspirants, had said that many bigwigs in the party were in the race because they were inheritors of a country of destiny and desired to work for the peace, unity and security of the nation.Speaking when he received members of the National Prosperity Movement from the North East and North West at his campaign office in Abuja, Fayemi said the APC wwould be a key factor and actor in the elections.“And that is as it should be, given that we are the ruling party at the centre and are responsible for governing 22 states in the federation. Easily, we are the most national of parties. We also remain the most sought-after political association in the land,” he said.Tinubu also said the increasing number of aspirants seeking the presidential ticket was good for democracy.He said the rising number of aspirants would put all the contenders on their toes, and dismissed fears that having many contenders could trigger a post-primary crisis in the party.Beyond the surfaceBut a former presidential candidate, Chief Martins Onovo, told our reporter in a telephone interview yesterday that the massive rush for APC presidential forms despite the huge cost was because President Buhari was indifferent. He said, “Some of them have been misled by the countenance of Mr President. They interpreted that to be support, even though the president has been telling all of them the same story.”Onovo also asked the anti-graft agencies in the country to go after the presidential aspirants who paid N100million for forms.  He said, “I invite the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and other anti-graft agencies to investigate APC aspirants who spent N100m just to get their expression of interest and nomination forms because it is encouraging corruption.”A chieftain of the party and former presidential candidate, Chief Chekwas Okorie, also said, “The reasons, to the best of my knowledge, may be drawn from two angles. One is the fact that the INEC as an electoral body has given people more confidence that the election would be free and fair. “Political parties, especially the major ones, have equally given the aspirants the confidence that they will not sit down in one corner and name a candidate; so everybody will have a fair chance.”A former member of the House of Representatives and 2023 governorship aspirant in Rivers State, Bernard Mikko said, “Many presidential aspirants are springing up because they have seen a democratic process. They feel the APC is more open than the opposition party, which is being controlled by one person.”But a chieftain of the party, Chief Jackson Lekan Ojo, said many of the aspirants were “investing for the future.”“What they are trying to do is negotiation for ministerial and other appointments in the future.“If you look at it, some aspirants are buying forms but they know who they are going to support. In a few days’ time, some of them will be stepping down for others, and there will be proper negotiations,” he said.A source who does not want to be named said some APC bigwigs who have a moral burden or baggage are in the race as part of their strategies to get cover from the party.Similarly, multiple sources told Daily Trust Saturday that some joined the race and paid the N100m fee as a way of funding the party indirectly and not necessarily to win the ticket. Questionable aspirants should be kicked out – StakeholdersA credible source in one of the security agencies said they were aware of what is happening.“We know the antics of most of the politicians. They are falling over themselves to evade arrest because some of them have corruption allegations. They want to remain in power all the time.“And you know how Nigerians behave; the moment we go after them, there will be uproar, including from the international community that we want to truncate democracy and we are restricting the political space,” he said.Some political pundits and party chieftains said that electing someone with a moral burden as the party’s presidential candidate or president in 2023 to succeed President Buhari would have serious implications on the country.Some of the stakeholders who spoke with our reporter said the act would spell doom for the country, and urged the electorate to vote wisely.A source who spoke on condition of anonymity said, “If you vote any of them who have not resolved his case with the EFCC or Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC), it will be a catastrophic failure.“But beyond that, no member of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) should aspire to be president because they have failed catastrophically.“If you claim you have excellent ideas but could not actualise it, being a member of the Executive Council with all the opportunities to get it done, please forget it. This FEC is clearly the worst in the history of Nigeria.”Another chieftain of the party said, “I think they are coming to fool Nigerians again. Most of them are saying they will continue from where Buhari would stop. That is to say we should be expecting more killings and high prices of foodstuff in the market. So, to me, none of them has the moral justification to contest for the presidency of this country.”But a former national chairman of the Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC), Chief Peter Ameh, told Daily Trust Saturday that inasmuch as some of the aspirants have a moral burden, they equally have the constitutional right to contest because they are presumed innocent until proven otherwise in court.Another source said many of the aspirants would drop their ambition in the coming days and collapse their structures in favour of some of the formidable aspirants.“This is not going to be the first time when some of the contenders would endorse others. In return, such aspirants would be paid back the monies they paid for the forms and all the logistics they incurred.“Above all, they are sure of serious patronage if the aspirant they supported emerge victorious because they would be given appointments or the opportunity to nominate others for ministerial and board membership. They would also be patronised with contracts,” he said.Some aspirants are in tight corner Daily Trust Saturday reports that some of the aspirants who are appointees of the government are currently in a tight corner over President Buhari’s directive that they should resign and face their campaigns.The impression they had before was that they would maintain their portfolios while campaigning for elective offices.And in the event they fail, they would seamlessly continue holding forte in the offices under their control.However, the recent directive by the president has unsettled some of them.Already, the Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio and Minister of Science and Technology, Ogbonnaya Onu, announced their resignation on Wednesday. But some of the ministers are in a tight corner as their chances of securing the party’s apex ticket are uncertain.They include Emefiele, Amaechi and the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), who is contesting for the Kebbi governorship ticket, among others.Buhari had directed that they should vacate their offices not later than May 16, 2022.",2023: Real Reasons Behind Mad Rush For APC Presidential Race

406,"2023: The intrigues and plans to stop OsinbajoBy Isa AdamuWith a little more than two weeks to the Special Convention of APC which holds on May 30th, it is becoming clearer and clearer that some of the presidential aspirants in the party only got into the race, not to win the nomination, but to stop Yemi Osinbajo by all means and make a way for Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. The mastermind of this scheme is Bola Ahmed Tinubu himself. Asiwaju is so desperate to clinch the party’s ticket that he is doing everything under the sun to stop the VP’s soaring acceptability across the nation. He believes that Prof Osinbajo is the only one standing between him and the nomination.First, Tinubu and his supporters spent weeks spreading malicious and false stories about the Vice President soon after his declaration on Monday, April 11. When that didn’t deter the VP or erode his brand as the man to beat, the former Lagos governor devised a new scheme in which he sponsored 10 people, including two ministers, to jump into the presidential race on condition that they would step down for him a day or two before the Convention. The idea is that when the 10 ‘aspirants’ announce that they’re stepping down for Tinubu, the announcement may create a momentum for him and that could motivate delegates to support him.The 10 sponsored aspirants are:1.       Senator Godswill Akpabio2.       Senator Rochas Okorocha3.       Comrade Adams Oshiomhole4.       Prof. Ben Ayade5.       Prof Emeka Nwajiuba6.       Senator Ken Nnamani7.       Ahmed Sani Yerima8.       Mrs. Uju Ohneye9.       Ajayi Borifice10.   Dimeji BankoleYou may have noticed that these 10 ‘shadow’ aspirants have not even gone around the country to meet and consult the delegates as the serious aspirants do. Osinbajo himself has visited over 20 states in the last four weeks, meeting with governors, traditional rules, party members and, of course, the delegates. Where has Oshiomhole or Ahmed Yerima been to? Have you seen Okorocha or Ken Nnamani consult anybody?Nigerians, be wise!",2023: The Intrigues And Plans To Stop Osinbajo
407,"Being Muslim Is A Condition For The Offence Blasphemy In Nigeria And Is Punishable By Death – Chief Justice Tanko Muhammad Ruled As Judge In 2007In 2007, while giving one of his rulings, the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad (then as Justice of the Supreme Court), stated categorically certain conditions before a defendant could be liable for the offence of blasphemy under Sharia in Nigeria.According to the head of the judicial arm of the government, the rule in Islam is that the defendant must be a mentally fit and mature Muslim before Sharia decree could be applied to them for the offence of blasphemy within the area of jurisdictionJustice Tanko made this verdict in the case of Abubakar Dan Shalla v. State (2007) LPELR-3034 (SC) where it was alleged that a group of persons, including the appellant, had stated that one Abdullar Alhaji Umaru (now deceased) made certain remarks which were insulting to Prophet Muhammed (S.A.W.) and that the deceased ought to be killed as prescribed in the Holy Quran for making the alleged remarks.They went in search of the deceased, laid their hands on him and slaughtered him with a knife. The incident was reported to the police on July 14, 1999. The appellant and five other persons were arrested for killing the deceased.Muhammad had said: ""The trite position of law under Sharia is that any sane and adult Muslim, who insults defames or utters words or acts which are capable of bringing into disrepute, odium contempt, the person of Holy Prophet Mohammed (SAW) such a person has committed a serious crime which is punishable by death. See Alkhursi, commentary on Mukhasar Al-khalil Vol. 8 page 70, Hashiyatul vol. 2 page 290.""However as observed by the court below, Islamic law has not left the killing open in the hands of private individuals. The offence alleged has to be established through evidence before a court of law. The court itself will have to implore its professional dexterity in treating the case by allowing fair hearing and excluding all the inadmissible evidence or those persons who may fall within the general exemption clause such as infant, slowpoke or those who suffer mental delusion.""Thus the killing is controlled and sanctioned by the authorities..... The law will thus, [would] have set a dangerous precedence if private individuals were authorized to take law into their hands as the appellant and others did in this case Sharia guarantees and values the sanctity and dignity of human life. That is why it outlaws unlawful killing of human life...""Meanwhile, something similar to the 2007 Dan Shalla's case was what happened in Sokoto on Thursday, but the victim, Deborah Samuel, was a Christian. SaharaReporters had earlier reported that Ms Deborah, a female Christian student, was killed and burnt on Thursday by her fellow students for allegedly insulting against Prophet Muhammad (SAW).The Sokoto State police command on Thursday confirmed the arrest of two students suspected to be involved in the  killing of a female student.http://saharareporters.com/2022/05/13/flashback-being-muslim-condition-offence-blasphemy-nigeria-and-punishable-death-%E2%80%93-chiefMynd44 Lalasticlala OAM4J Ijebabe",Chief Judge Of Nigeria: Only Muslims Can Be Punished For Blasphemy Under Sharia
408,"Twenty-five of the 29 presidential aspirants that purchased the All Progressives Congress (APC) expression of interest and nomination forms are now in the frame to face the party’s screening panel later today having submitted their completed forms at press time last night.￼The screening will last two days ahead of the primary slated for May 28.Those who beat the deadline yesterday include Asiwaju Bola Tinubu; Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; President African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr Akinwunmi Adesina; immediate past Minister of Science and Technology, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu and Senate President Ahmad Lawan.But the same could not be said of former President Goodluck Jonathan and Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor Godwin Emefiele both of whom did not turn in the forms bought for them by “friends and well-wishers.”A source at the APC national secretariat said the two men “have up till midnight to submit their forms. But as at 9 pm, we have not seen them or their agents.”Simultaneously, a group approached a Federal High Court, Abuja praying it to bar the former president from participating as a candidate in the next presidential election, while a Delta State High Court, Kwale, restrained the board of the CBN and the Independent National Electoral Commission  (INEC) from stopping Emefile from seeking an elective post.The Nation gathered that the legal directorate of the party on Thursday began the vetting of documents submitted by all aspirants with a view to determining the authenticity of the papers.A source in the department said the party leadership learnt a big lesson from the last minute disqualification of the party’s governorship candidate and his deputy in Bayelsa State due to some lapses in the documentation of the then deputy governor-elect.“We are going through all the papers filed by all the aspirants in order to avoid any avoidable mistakes. Anyone with past criminal records or convictions will not be allowed to contest. We want to mitigate any post-election litigation that can upturn our victory,” the source said.Other presidential aspirants whose nomination forms were received at press time were former Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi; former Minister of Niger Delta Development, Sen. Godswill Akpabio; former Imo State governor, Sen. Rochas Okorocha; and former Ogun State governor, Sen. Ibikunle Amosun.Others were Pastor Tunde Bakare; Cross River State governor, Prof. Ben Ayade; his Ebonyi State counterpart, Gov.

409,"WHO EMPOWERED KANU TO ARM YOUTHS WITH AK47-ESN?Ifeanyi ChijiokeFacebook14 May 2022I am yet to understand the defense counsel of the leader of IPOB- ESN. Could it be they are not telling us something we need to know? They could be presenting this matter as if though they are in a legal battle with the federal government while behind the scene, they are pleading and negotiating.Alternatively; it could be their grand plan is to stall the case until Buhari hands over, which will ultimately give them a new opportunity to politick their way to technical pardon. From every indication; there is nothing the defense counsel can do if not to make a plea bargain.Instead of shamelessly lying and hiding face in court, there is pride in taking arms for Biafra but when you fail, you accept your fate than insult yourself.When addressing members of IPOB; Barr.  Ifeanyi Ejiofor presents this case as if he has upper hand but evidences on ground point to the opposite direction. There could be a move intended to avoid psychological blow on the members of IPOB while discreetly going about delay tactics to finding the favorable situation for guilty plea or jumping into politics for deescalation.Recently, after visiting Kanu; Ejiofor told their cash cows they (defense) team are preparing to strike out the upheld charges against Nnamdi Kanu which would automatically make Nnamdi Kanu an innocent man. That quickly pushed me to ask the above question; because there might be somewhere in the constitution where Kanu derived the power to arm youths in the name of ESN and unleashed them against the people.If the charges against Nnamdi Kanu are narrowed to only arming youths with the intention to fight the constitution of Nigeria that empowered Fulani and other people to live and walk freely in Nigeria, won’t he be found guilty?  Let us subtract attacks that were recorded that Kanu openly accepted responsibilities; where will the defense come from?I am not a lawyer; but being this is Nigeria, nothing is impossible, yet, I have a premonition that the defense team is playing dirty to save Nnamdi Kanu’s life in prison. I have seen situation lawyers after court case meet behind the scene to explore exit means after concealed compromise. Could that be on the table for Nnamdi Kanu?Nnamdi Kanu has shamelessly refused to boldly accept he attacked the sovereignty of Nigeria because of Biafra, instead, he denied being a member of IPOB, whether proscribed or not. Nnamdi Kanu has further lied to the court that he was agitating for the betterment of Igbo and not for a separate state. It is ridiculous; he has been shameless and ready to deny everything.  His demand for Ishiagu instead of Biafran colour material is a strategic means of communicating that he is fighting for Igbo and not Biafra. I have never seen a man as cowardly as Nnamdi Kanu; who is ready to throw away everything for a life that will still be lost with time. It can only take a brave man to tell the government; everything you accuse me is because of Biafra and what I want is Biafra. The bottom line is clear; Nnamdi Kanu’s lawyers are in close contact with the government and relying on political influence for the freedom of their client. There is practically no way a man that set up a personal militia and received guard of honor, publicly armed youths to carry out his order against the constitution of the republic of Nigeria can escape the wrath of the law unless there is a negotiation and possible compromise we are not privy to. Ifeanyi Ejiofor should know that free people are agitating for the restoration of Biafra aside Ubini Ukpabi enslaved urchins that swallow hook and sinker everything he says. He can go behind the scene pleading and demanding for political solution while bragging he is fighting legally for the release of his client. A one Nigerianist counsel was employed to help facilitate reconciliation and not legal battle. I wish good luck but members of IPOB deserve to know what is going on; at least, they need to know it's over.

412,"This was circulated in a statement released on Friday, May 13, 2022. Through the statement, the MURIC leader regarded the murder as horrible and without legal justification.The Director of The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), Professor Ishaq Akintola has criticised the killing of a student, Deborah Samuel, over alleged blasphemy in Sokoto on Thursday.This was circulated in a statement released on Friday, May 13, 2022. Through the statement, the MURIC leader regarded the murder as horrible and without legal justification.The statement reads: ""A female student of the Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto, Deborah Samuel, was on Thursday killed for allegedly blaspheming against the Prophet Muhammad (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The blaspheme statement was reportedly posted on a WhatsApp group.“She was asked to withdraw the statement but she allegedly refused to do so. The school’s security unit and police were overwhelmed by the crowd when they tried to rescue her.“MURIC strongly condemns this killing and all others that have been happening in Nigeria in recent times. Those aggrieved by the student’s post should have reported her to the security agencies or the Shariah police, the hisbah. Mob killing is archaic and bohemian. It belongs to the Stone Age. Nobody has the right to take the law into his hands. “The Glorious Qur’an compares the killing of a single person to the killing of the whole of humanity just as it compares the saving of life to the rescue of all homo sapiens (Qur’an 5:32) In like manner, Prophet Muhammad (SAW) himself condemned all acts of violence and advocated peaceful conduct at all times. “But this incident should not be condemned in isolation. The recent trend whereby Nigerians now freely shed their brothers' blood should be condemned by all patriots. In this regard, we also strongly denounce the killing of several Northern Muslims in the South East in the past few months.“We frown on the recent burning last week of a truck fully loaded with cows in the South East as well as the killing of many Muslims of South-East origin by their Igbo brothers in the same South East. We note with keen interest that Muslims in the North did not retaliate when these killings were taking place. “MURIC calls on the Sokoto Police Command to do everything within its power to get to the bottom of yesterday's killing of the female student over alleged blasphemy. We appeal to members of the public to remain calm and law-abiding. Nigerians should allow the police to carry out their investigations on the case. The Sokoto Police Command has started well as it already has two suspects in detention for the killing.“Meanwhile we remind Nigerians to always exercise restraint on matters of religion. Free speech is no longer free if it amounts to religious provocation. Even the European Court has ruled that the utterance of derisive statements against the prophet of any religion is a crime.“We affirm clearly, categorically and unequivocally that there is a symbiotic relationship between provocation, violence and extremism. While MURIC will not condone extremism and violence, the anatomy of terrorism is becoming clearer day by day. We must all ponder over the causal-effect theory. Violence and terrorism are mere symptoms. The real disease is a provocation. Violence and terrorism are mere smoke. Provocation is the fire and we all know that there is no smoke without fire. “We, therefore, appeal to Nigerians to desist from insulting, deriding or abusing the prophets of other religions. Muslims should continue to respect Jesus (peace be upon him) whom the Christians hold very dear. In the same vein, Christians should avoid casting aspersion on the person of Prophet Muhammad (SAW). We have experienced enough religious crises in the land,"" the statement added.MURIC is an Islamic human rights organisation. http://saharareporters.com/2022/05/13/don%E2%80%99t-insult-prophets-other-religions-violence-terrorism-are-mere-symptoms-provocation","Don’t Insult Prophets Of Others; Violence, Terrorism Are Mere Symptoms,-MURIC"

I’m extremely pleased. And I'm sure the delegates had a very good time interacting with me and trying to interrogate what my views are about what the future should look like,” he said.In his meetings with the delegates in both states, Prof. Osinbajo restated the commitment of the Buhari administration to address the country’s security challenges and his vision for the country if elected in 2023.Speaking earlier at the palace of the Ewi of Ado-Ekiti,  where he met the Ekiti State Traditional Council, and Ewi- Oba Rufus Adeyemo Adejugbe, the VP thanked the traditional rulers for always being there and ready to give sound advice and counsel, as well as his warm hospitality and time.Prof. Osinbajo further said that, having served in office as vice president and worked under a transparent President that has given him every opportunity to participate in governance and fully understand the issues, “God has given me this knowledge and exposure so that in due course, and I believe the time has arrived, I will be able to put myself forward and use all that God has given me, through learning and experience, in the service of our country.“I must add that my sole objective is to serve this country and the people, with everything I have learnt and that I have.”In his remarks, Oba Rufus Adeyemo Adejugbe noted that Prof. Osinbajo was “eminently qualified for the job” (to become president).“The Bible says ""Paul plants, Apolo waters; but increase is by the grace of God. So we are praying that by the grace of God, you get there and when you are there, remember the traditional institution. “We (traditional rulers) should have a role in the constitution of this country, not advisory position alone, so that when there are challenges, like we have now, we can have a voice that will be respected. I pray God Almighty will direct your thoughts, protect you, guide you and take you back to Abuja safely.”As he often does in his interactive meetings with the APC delegates and stakeholders, the Vice President spent time in each State taking questions and exchanging ideas on major national issues and also discussing political issues.Before he departed for Ondo and Ekiti States yesterday, the VP had represented the President at an Infrastructure Solutions Summit in Abuja. Today he has also received the Secretary-General of the Organisation of African, Caribbean and Pacific States, Mr. Georges Rebelo Pinto Chikoti, and is expected to meet with APC delegates in Akwa Ibom later today.Laolu AkandeSenior Special Assistant to the President on Media & PublicityOffice of the Vice President13th May, 2022",2023 Presidential Bid: How Vp's Consultations With Apc Delegates Are Progressing

Shaykh `Ali Al-Ḥudhaifi al-`Adani the Yemeni is different from Shaykh `Ali Al-Ḥudhaifi of Medinah. Question was asked by @pristinemethod Pristine Methodology of Nigeria. . https://twitter.com/OvieNews/status/1525550679661715457?s=19The Ruling of the one who Insults the Prophet -may Allah's highest exaltation and peace be upon him. This is a question that has come from the brothers in Nigeria, the brothers say in it: ""there is a Christian lady that insulted the Prophet -may Allah's highest exaltation and peace be upon him-, so, some people killed her and burnt her and they captured this event with video. So, the question now is, Is this action permissible and what is your advice for those people""?The answer -and guidance is with Allah: 1. Insulting the prophet -may Allah's highest exaltation and peace be upon him- is a great evil and disbelief in Allah by the consensus of the Ummah. It is something that hurts the heart of the believer and this is something that the Muslims have no difference regarding it. 2. Confronting this action in this manner, which is the people killing and burning the one who made the insult without going back to those in charge of affairs is a great error that some people fall into due to zealousness without knowledge. So, this action is not permissible and it is an action that is not correct for several reasons: - The first of it, implementing the prescribed punishments is not for individuals and it is not for anyone, it is for those in charge and this is based on consensus.- Secondly, implementing the prescribed Shari'ah punishment occurs when those in charge cut off the neck of the one who insulted the prophet -may Allah's highest exaltation and peace be upon him-, then the one who is killed is buried in the graves. This is the ruling of the noble punishment on him because implementing the prescribed punishments is from the jurisdiction of the one in authority"" 2nd Page 3. What is compulsory regarding this situation is to refer the case of the one who insulted the prophet -may Allah's highest exaltation and peace be upon him- to the governmental authority and it is the government that will summon the one who is accused of insulting the prophet -may Allah's highest exaltation and peace be upon him-, look at the validity of the accusation, and inspect the conditions to implement the prescribed punishment on him and the inhibitions, Then, they will implement the prescribed punishment, if the conditions are met and the inhibitions are absent. 4. It is legislated for the Muslims to seek from the government to prohibit insulting the Prophet -may Allah, highest exaltation and peace be upon him- and implement the prescribed punishment on the one who insults him -may Allah, highest exaltation and peace be upon him-5. If it is known that the government will do nothing, then patience is necessary and calling to Allah with wisdom and good admonition. Indeed, the pagans of Qumysh in Makkah used to often insult the Prophet -may Allah, highest exaltation and peace be upon him- and describe him with magic, poem, sorcery and similar things to that. They used to harm in different ways, they would place the intestine of the camels on him, so, they would harm the prophet -may Allah, highest exaltation and peace be upon him-with their speech and action. And the believers were not capable to repel that from the prophet -may Allah, highest exaltation and peace be upon him- and Allah did not hold them responsible for anything and there was no blame on them from anyone because they were weak. Rather, the prophet -may Allah's highest exaltation and peace be upon him- was commanded with patience, over-looking and pardoning. And indeed there am many verses commanding Shari'ah and it is not by burning the one who was killed, this is not from the Shari'ah. This action that some people did with regards to killing the Christian lady and burning her corpse, there are many evils in it: . First, it is upon other than the way of the Prophet -may Allah's highest exaltation and peace be upon him-. Second, It incites the government against the people of sunnah, so they oppose them and tighten their grip on them.. Third, it opens the door for foreign nations to cause commotion between the Muslims and Christians.. Fourth, It distorts the image of the Muslims in the view of the enemies, rather, it might chase those who want to accept Islam away from it. Footnote 1. In the Verdicts of the Permanent Committee for verdicts and research (V22/P5): ""No one implements the prescribed punishments except the Muslim Sultan or the one that represents him to actualize law and order; preventing transgression and safety from injustice"" Also in the verdict of the Permanent Committee for verdicts and research (V22/P7): ""None establish the prescribed punishments except for the Muslim ruler or the one who stands in the position of the ruler and it is not permissible for individuals among the Muslims to implement the prescribed punishments because of what that will cause of unrest and turmoil."" Also in the verdict of the Permanent Committee for verdicts and research (V22/P8): ""It is not for you to implement the prescribed with patience when much insult is heard from those who were given the book (Jews and Christians) and the Pagans. Thus, Some of them (scholars) said ""it was abrogated by the verse of war, collection of jizyah and similar things to that"". And others said: ""they are applied when there is weakness"" Shaykhul Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said in 'The Unsheathed Sword' (V I/P239): ""among people are those who say that the command of pardoning remains when there is need for it due to weakness of the Muslims from fighting, sich that they are in a time or a place they are incapable to do it. So such is not abrogated, for the abrogated is what has been uplifted in all future times"" And may the highest exaltation of Allah, peace and blessing be upon His slave and messenger, our prophet Muhammad, his household and his companions Shaykh Ali Al-Hudhaifi 12th of Shawwal 1443H Translated by Abu Anwar An-Naijiriy 13th-May-2022",Shaykh Ali Al-Ḥudhaifi Condemns the Killing Of Deborah Samuel

421,"Atiku and his group of scaremongers should therefore be disregarded. After the eight-year rule of a Northern Muslim, fairness, equity and common sense demand that the presidency should go down South and specifically to a Southern Christian. The argument that only a North-centric candidate can win is faulty and introduces a dangerous dimension to our body politic. Assuming that the political parties were to fall for this line of reasoning this time, what about the next election cycle? The point is that this argument can be made infinitum, which implies that the major parties will keep presenting far Northern Muslim candidates ‘in order to win.’ That is inconceivable. Our country is already at a tipping point and we should be very deliberate about our actions at this time in order not to push the cart over the wall. https://www.premiumtimesng.com/opinion/529518-the-2023-presidential-election-and-the-demonisation-of-zoning-by-julius-ogunro.html","The 2023 Presidential Election And The Demonization Of Zoning, By Julius Ogunro"

They are agents of death amidst us.We recall the provocative and demeaning advertisement of the Sterling Bank where the bank compared the Resurrection of Jesus Christ to “Agege bread"", up till now, nobody was attacked and even the CAN leadership has accepted the apology tendered by its Chief Executive, Abubakar Suleiman. Killing for any God in the name of blasphemy is ungodly, satanic, foolish, reprehensible and totally unacceptable.This is not a Stone Age and Nigeria is not a Banana Republic. Nigeria remains a non-religious State where no religion is supreme to the other.We acknowledge and commend the restraint of the Christian students of the College who refused to embrace self-help and reprisal attacks on those who murdered their colleague. It is our prayers that those vampires in religious garments will not push the country to a religious war.This is why both the government and the security agencies must stop treating them with kid gloves. Enough is enough.CAN commiserates with the family of Deborah and other bereaved. May God console and comfort them in Jesus Name.Thanks to many other Nigerians who condemned this heinous crime.

431,"With the collection/submission of Governorship expression and nomination  forms by Hon Abdulkabir Adekunle Akinlade popularly known with sobriquet Triple A, he has finally returned to a familiar turf where the batton was forcefully hijacked from him in 2019 Governorship contest. It has been about 3 years of patience and waiting. The speculation has been quite rife within the political discourse across the State. Some political speculators and merchants of power game were even magistrial and categorical; Triple A cannot contest for  governorship again. To them, he was down and out. Those ones should take their wrong postulation in their stride now that Triple A is back in the race. For Triple A, the 3 years of political silence has been quite reflective, engaging and strategic. It has been years of retrospection, introspection and proper planning for the days at hand and coming ones. Lessons has been learnt from past experience. Now the waiting game is over for his political admirers across the state. It's now time to set sail again. Like the Yoruba proverb he's found of says ""(Ti Esin Ba Dani, A ma tun gu ni"". My direct translation of this will be, when you take a fall from a horse, you have to mount it again. As the great Nelson Mandela of blessed memory said "" It always seems impossible until it is done"" From general perception, uprooting an incumbent Governor who is also interested in the race look daunting but Triple A believes that the difficulty of a task does not necessarily means it is impossible. In any case, history is replete with incumbent Governors that have lost their reelection bids. Even incumbent President like president Goodluck Jonathan lost in 2015 with all the power and its ancillary. Artillery of knowledge is always greater than knowledge of artillery which is always going to be limited in scope. Among those presently in the governorship race across the various political parties in Ogun State, Triple A has name recognition. Aside the incumbent Governor, Triple A is the only one who had been to election proper before. Others presently in the race never had this kind of distinct experience. It does not come easy. One or two with such experiences are not in the governship race but something else. As such, no one in the Governorship race presently can match his kind of forbearance and fortitude. Triple A story is one of grit, drive, determination, focus, talent and immense grace of God. It is the story of the man that cling to people of Ogun State like heavy downpour of Autumn rain in 2019 electioneering process and thereafter. Aside the incumbent factor on the part of the sitting Governor, Triple A is the man to beat in the race particularly from same political structure. He is dogged and committed to lofty goals and beliefs. The reason he is back in the race is out of conviction that Ogun State deserves a better deal than what is currently at play. Triple A is mentally stable, highly pragmatic even in the face daunting uphill obstacles. He is ideologically sound with big dreams that will definitely give Ogun State a quantum leap kind of development. He has knack not just for public finance theories but also investment applications, corporate world and ways of doing things at the highest level that can only be beneficial to humanity. Presently, we can say it is morning yet on the creation day with the submission of forms. But the days ahead promises to be highly engaging for the people of Ogun State. Triple A is all out to play a pivotal role in chatting rightful course of development for the people of Ogun State. He is not in the race just to fulfill all righteousness or just a participant like an Olympian. He is the race for the real deal.

The data on the portal of the agency showed that the number of NIN issued to Nigerians stands at 80.7 million as of April 23, 2022.Following the ban, registration for NIN increased by 4.67 per cent from 77.1 million as of March 21, 2022, to 80.7 million as of April 23, 2022.According to a breakdown of the data, about 20.56 million NINs have been issued in the North-Western part of the nation; 20.23 million in the South-West; 13.59 million in the North-Central, 9.96 million in the North-East, 9.34 million in the South-South, and 6.87 million in the South-East.Recall that the agency on the 4th of April barred about 72.77 million active telecommunication subscribers from making calls on their SIMs following the enforcement of the Federal Government’s SIM-NIN policy.As of the time of implementing the policy, 125 million subscribers had linked their NINs to their SIMs, while 78 million NINs had been issued.The Chairman, of the Association of Licensed Telecoms Operators of Nigeria, Gbenga Adebayo, in an interview with Punch claimed that more subscribers had since submitted their NINs for linkage.According to him, as more subscribers submit their NINs, the number of people with deactivated lines will reduce.He said, “I don’t have the current statistics, but I can say the numbers are looking up. We have more players, and more people are submitting their NINs every day as they become available.“Things are looking up, compliance level has improved significantly, and we are hoping that as more people have their NINs captured and submit their NINs to operators, people complaining that their lines are deactivated will naturally ease out. But the numbers are looking up.”Commenting on the plight of subscribers, the National Association of Telecoms Subscribers, Adeolu Ogunbanjo, stated that subscribers were still struggling to get their NINs, to link them with their SIMs.He said, “There is still a long way to go. About 72 million subscribers are still struggling with making calls.“If ALTON says there is an improvement, I want to believe it is on the upload side. The uptake capacity is still slow. The operation is cumbersome, apart from that, it is slow. It is still taking them much time to generate NIN. It still takes about one week to generate a NIN, if you are lucky. Most people who want to get their work done at a relatively fast pace still have to pay. This situation has birthed a racketeering ring.” Source: https://naijanews.com/NIN-Registration-Hits-80.7-Million-19-Days-After-SIM-Ban",NIN Registration Hits 80.7 Million 19 Days After SIM Ban

435,"Ikechukwu Maximus Ugwuoke, National Welfare Secretary Aspirant of Nigerian Bar Association received a thunderous ovation from members of the Unity bar, the Abuja Branch of NBA when he informed them that he is also known as ""Hakuna Matata"" during his introduction and greetings to the bar at the branch meeting held on 12th May 2022.  Fielding answers to the questions from newsmen who interviewed him on why he is called Hakuna Matata after the meeting Ugwuoke said:  ""Well, the words ‘Hakuna Matata' are etymologically Swahili language which means 'no worries; be happy'. ""Hakuna Matata seems to have taken over my proper names amongst my friends and acquaintances. It all started about ten years ago when the spiritual director of Adoration Ministry Enugu, Rev Fr Ejike Mbaka delivered one of his sermon titled 'Hakuna Matata' during one of his ministry's programme in  Enugu in 2012. That year, I was to contest the office of the social secretary of the NBA of my branch , the Enugu Branch. I so much cherished the title and content of the sermon that I used it as the heading of the Campaign poster I printed for the election. On the day of the election I also came to the branch election venue with a box that has the inscription 'Hakuna Matata' on its sides. During my introduction before the voting started,  I informed the members of the branch that all I wanted to achieve if elected as the social Secretary of the branch then was to make them happy and forget their worries and that the  packages I have for this were inside the Hakuna Matata box I was holding.  Of course, it was fun and the mother of my manifestoe that made me win the election. From that point on, all the lawyers in the branch who didn't know me before then started calling me Hakuna Matata. Initially I was worried that it was taking over my proper name such that if  someone is asking most lawyers about me in Enugu and you mention my proper name Ikechukwu Maximus Ugwuoke only few lawyers would agree they know me, but just mention Hakuna Matata and almost all will tell you 'yes we know him'. Fr Mbaka seems to have popularized the name the more as he too has continued to address me as Hakuna Matata till date instead of my proper name. My regime as social secretary of the branch was really an Hakuna Matata regime for the lawyers with lots of stress- relieving programs we had then for lawyers some of which included, walk for life, getting comedians to liven the branch dinner etc. 'Originally the name of the law firm I founded about that time was 'El-Maximus Ugwuoke & Co, breakthrough Partners '. But due to my popularity with the name Hakuna Matata, I had to add 'Hakuna Matata Chambers' to the firm's name during its registration to reflect my identity.Ugwuoke further narrated. “At the last Enugu monthly Bar meeting when I informed the branch of my submission of Nomination form for the position of the National Welfare Secretary of NBA, one senior lawyer Okwuliehe Esq asked me about the Hakuna Matata Box. I simply told him that the content of the box has been reviewed to encapsulate the Maximum Welfare which is my vision for the NBA that will be unsealed at National level of the bar when the time comes. He could not contain his laughter""Ugwuoke commended the unity bar for the privilege they give him during the meeting to address them and interact with the members of the branch who gave him a good treat during the meeting.","Why People Call Me Hakuna Matata, Maximus Ugwuoke Reveals, Commends Abuja Bar"

The presence of a leader talking to his followers.Nigerians are alien to Peter Obi personality. They have never seen a man like him that made governance so simple and More of services . Nigerians have been abused by political miscreants masquerading and lording over them . Today, they felt the presence of a leader who want to serve and rescue them.Imagine a Governor entering the flood to go rescue a man whose business was destroyed by flood and wanting to commit suicide.A governor holding town hall meeting and a Jss1 student stood up to remind him of his promise he made to renovate their school. He left the town hall meeting, went to a commercial bank , cash out the money and handed it over to the student who gave it to her principal and teachers who were present.Imagine a governor who had all the phone number of the senior prefect in his state and communicated with them to know the issue they were facing in school .Man was paying 5k to every 70 years and above residing in villages .Imagine a governor who doesn't own a single land in Anambra state .Imagine a governor whose daughter is a secondary school Teacher and his son doesn't own a car.That young girl Amina in the studio has already been bought over .

439,"A network of Nigerian separatists based outside the country is using social media to call for violence and incite ethnic hatred against opponents of Biafran independence, a BBC investigation has found.Warning: This article contains graphic descriptions of violenceIn a Facebook live broadcast to her more than 40,000 followers, Efe Uwanogho, also known as Omote Biafra, shouts hate speech directly into the camera.The front of her leather jacket features a patch of the Biafran flag, with its red, black and green tricolour and half a rising sun.ADVERTISEMENT""Go after these mighty saboteurs… Those are the people that need to be beheaded. Those are the people that need to be burnt to ashes,"" she says.She's calling for attacks against those considered enemies of the campaign for Biafran independence, which would create a breakaway state in south-east Nigeria.The campaign has a bloody history.In 1967 separatists from the mainly Igbo region declared independence for the Republic of Biafra. They fought and lost a three-year civil war against the Nigerian government in which more than a million died, mainly on the separatist side.Biafran soldiers seen here inspecting a bomb during the Biafran conflict, 11th June 1968.IMAGE SOURCE,GETTY IMAGESImage caption,The war ended in 1970 but the idea of Biafra lives onMore than half a century later, social media is a new frontline for those who are continuing the struggle.Ms Uwanogho is among them. She's a so-called ""media warrior"" for the separatist group known as the Indigenous People of Biafra (Ipob).She broadcasts from Italy, beyond the reach of Nigerian authorities. In Nigeria, Ipob has been banned and designated a terror group. Ipob insists it is a peaceful movement.The BBC's investigation revealed many other influential Ipob supporters also operating outside the country, openly promoting disinformation and inciting violence on social media from across Europe, the US, Asia and other parts of Africa.Nigerian investigative journalist Nicholas Ibekwe describes the group's online operation as an ""organised troll farm"".""Social media has been Ipob's most successful tool in achieving most of what it wants to achieve today,"" he says.Composite image of Nneka Igwenagu (left) and Efe Uwanogho (right)Image caption,Nneka Igwenagu (L) and Efe Uwanogho (R) broadcast from outside NigeriaSome supporters of the group have as many as 100,000 followers on social media.We don't know if any of Ms Uwanogho's followers took action based on her online calls for violence against officials in south-eastern Nigeria.Ms Uwanogho did not respond to a request for comment on this story.But on the ground, the violence is real, with dozens of officials killed in attacks already this year in violence described by President Muhammadu Buhari as ""deeply distressing"".Nneka Igwenagu is another ""media warrior"" fighting for the Biafran cause, based in the UK.In a Facebook live broadcast from London in late 2021, she targets a youth group in Anambra, south-east Nigeria, which had been resisting pressure from Ipob for people in the region to shut down businesses and schools in solidarity with the group's detained leader Nnamdi Kanu.Nnamdi KanuIMAGE SOURCE,AFPImage caption,Ipob leader Nnamdi Kanu has endorsed the activities of many ""media warriors""Mr Kanu is currently being held by Nigerian authorities and faces terror charges, which he denies.Speaking in Igbo, the most widely spoken language in south-eastern Nigeria, Ms Igwenagu refers to them as ""chickens"", saying:""All of you are not supposed to be alive… A chicken that ate its eggs, don't you see it is not supposed to live?""A few weeks after the broadcast, the leader of the youth group she was referring to was shot and killed. Nobody has been charged over his death.Flyer showing news of the death of Ogidi youth leader, with picture of him wearing a blue t shirt and text saying ""exit of a hero""Image caption,Tributes were paid to the Ogidi youth leader online after his killingWe contacted Ms Igwenagu for a comment on this investigation, but received no response.One of the ways the media warriors attempt to avoid censorship is to switch into local languages that are less well moderated.This tactic is made explicit in one video we found. Okenna Okechukwu, also known as Biafran Child, speaks in Igbo when calling for the beheading of a critic, before switching to English and explaining to his followers:""Why I am saying this in my dialect is because I don't want them to stop me. I don't want them to block me on this page.""David Ajikobi, Nigeria editor of fact-checking organisation Africa Check, says that the lack of moderation of extreme content in local languages is a major issue, not limited to Nigeria.""We've also seen this in India, in Ethiopia, where crises are happening, people are using local language because they know that if they use English they will be flagged and will be removed from the platform.""Despite the violent nature of many of the online posts we found, moderation by social media platforms is inconsistent.In line with Facebook's own process, our team reported broadcasts by Efe Uwanogho and Nneka Igwenagu for containing violent content. We initially received a notification that the platform had decided not to take the videos down.It was only later, when the BBC shared links to the posts directly with Facebook that they were removed. But violent broadcasts from the same accounts, as well as others, remained online at the time of publication.Stoking tensionFacebook's parent company Meta told us in a statement that calling for violence on its platform was unacceptable. It said that it had 15,000 people reviewing content in more than 70 languages - including Igbo.Our investigation also found Ipob supporters spreading disinformation to stoke tension between different ethnic groups in Nigeria.Media warriors pit ethnic Igbo people, who are mainly Christian and from the south, against those from the Fulani ethnic group, who are predominantly Muslim and from the north.In another Facebook live broadcast, Ms Igwenagu warns her followers that Fulani herders and other northerners who have moved to ""Biafraland"" are on a ""mission… to exterminate, kill maim, wipe [out] all of us"".Payment for postsAlthough there have been clashes between Fulani herders and communities in the south-east, there is no evidence of the sort of conspiracy that Ms Igwenagu and others are alleging.This violent rhetoric may be driven by a desire for Biafran independence, but our investigation also found evidence of financial incentives for those involved.We found videos in which media warriors admitted to being paid, either by Ipob or by supporters, for the work they do and we saw other broadcasts in which bank details for Ipob were shared to solicit donations from followers.Journalist Nicholas Ibekwe is among those who are critical of social media companies to tackle the violent threats being made on their platforms.""It seems Facebook has really really gone to sleep. It does not think that these comments, these posts that they do on Facebook have consequences.""Audu M Linus (retired) and Private (Pte)Gloria MatthewImage caption,Audu Linus and Gloria Matthew were attacked on the way to their weddingMeanwhile, attacks continue on the ground.On 30 April, Nigerian soldiers Audu Linus and Gloria Matthew were on their way to get married in a traditional ceremony in Imo state when they were abducted, tortured and killed by unidentified attackers.Footage showing the couple's killing, which the Nigerian president has blamed on Ipob, then went viral.A conspiracy theory was then widely shared by some Ipob supporters claiming that the footage was not real and the soldiers' deaths had been staged.The BBC has independently confirmed the deaths of the two soldiers with family members.Ipob has denied any involvement in the killing.We contacted Ipob's leadership with our findings from this investigation.

444,"Curbing Religious Intolerance In The Bud. In Memory Of The Brave Deborah Samuel.For those of you cowards who try to justify the death of this innocent girl and choose to distance yourself from this subject, I must say your cowardice is loud enough for the world to see. I still can't wrap my head around this that this innocent young lady deserved death in the hands of these deranged and radicalized elements or mobsters because she insulted prophet Mohammed Is this not the same way, style and reason how and why Bokoharam, bandits and the rest of their likes claim to be killing and beheading in the name of religion and infidels? This I think the insecurity rampaging the north is a self inflicted pain as the North is now the head quarter of terrorism and insurgency in Nigeria. These are the faces and community that birth and midwife terrorism in Nigeria and if government need to fight insurgency, we need to first reorientate the larger masses of the northern Islamic faithfuls else the war against insurgency may never end soon because most of these radicalized guys are demons in the guise of religion. Look at them in the video and you would see they have no life and nothing to live for with a signature of poverty written all over them as they all have common semblance of zombies with a cheap and savage religious command of attack and destroy. Now all the evils and prophesy and forecast about the North are coming to fruition. With this ideology, I doubt if anything good can happen to the north again because many like Samuel Deborah have died in the hands of misinformed and deranged minds like these ones.Anyway, if you are a notherner or resident in the north, regardless of your religion or faith or ideology and you don't feel the collective duty to nip this issue in the bud, you or any close member of your family may be next because the North is already on fire with this same kind of flopped and crappy religious intolerant and religious ideology  that has birth many radical and terrorist movements such has banditry, herdsmen restiveness and bokoharam, ISWAP e.t.c that has engulfed the entire North such that even the Islamic Caliphates are not spared. You see fire is a good servant but a bad master and I must say with life and energy that the fire you set to your neighbor's house would sooner or later catch up with you. This is what we get when we tend to polarize each other with religious yardsticks. The Islamic clerics have a lot to do in putting out this fire, They know exactly what to do. The same way the crisis played out to a national scale in countries like North and South Sudan, Uganda, Ethiopia, Mali, Congo DR, Equitorial Guinea,This innocent lady Deborah has found her peace at least she is now free from the madness of being one of us and been a Nigerian which am sure she was never proud of. Am sure she felt she has had it up to her neck and that was the only way to fight back by speaking up for those who are still ready to cowardly continue playing partisanship. She died a free lady and a martyr speaking up where alot are afraid of been stifled to speak up. How many pints and cup of blood would this our vampire of an ideology have to gorge??She stood for justice in the face of her coward executioners and mobsters and a failed system that was inept to timely intervene in her rescue from the hands of the unclean and savage mobsters. This is madness in the 21st Century, millenia and in a digital age. I supposed such would never have happened if it were to be in Russia where you have a mad and tyrant President like Putin who is the worst of all bullies and national figure in the world. This is exactly the reason why the North and south must split because its obvious there is omission of common ideology here just as Obafemi Awolowo once opined that until the fundamentals of our union as a nation are top on the list void of religious and tribal oppression, the north would not only continue to eat itself up with a folly and sentimental religious polity but would most likely become a battle ground breeding its own problems in its sham and veil of religious apostates And educating these miscreants and radicalised lots and children of destructions may do little or nothing without first addressing the ills of their religious values, over indulgence and fanatism. All these guys are terrorist in disguise and not different from the bokoharam they intiated and fuelled till it became a full scale national crisis. People insult God and Jesus and God and Even Mohammed everyday in advance countries and their religious faithfuls don't fight back nor bite. All in the name of religion? This is exactly the misgivings and gap our corrupt and double faced leaders are capitalizing on to milk us dry. We are polarizing the country and polity with Religious sentiments. Its a big shame whereas Islamic countries like Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia that are also Muslim countries have all left Nigeria long ago to focus more on industrialization and value adding matters that addresses the fundamental needs of the people because they believe if you die hungry and die poor you may suffer the same fate wherever you are going in the after life. Here we just chose to make ourselves useless in the name of religion and our opportunist politicians are taking advantage of this to break the bank and sponsor any attempt to perfect this skill, art and act of religious mediocrity. A borrowed religion that is not in anyway ancestral to the custom land. Wether Islam or Christianity or of any sort, honestly we all need to get our brain checked both Christan and Muslims when it comes to matters of peace and religious intolerance because this ethnic, religious and tribal divides on the rampage is worse than the Covid 19 Virus carelessly unleashed from the Wuhan Chinese lab. God fight for himself and need nobody to defend him. Religion to me is a cult as most of us know its an opium of the masses which we now see its no longer pulling much weight in the dimension of empirical and scientific values for the purpose of humanity development and material supplies even if it finds a soft spot or substance in the place of literature, culture and cohesive social values. Religion has long been a potent literature myth that we ought to by now long demystify as I believe it is aimed to unite people and bring people together and not to break nor scare people away. Social inclusion on grounds of religion should be a thing of choice and free will and not by compulsion. This is why Dangote and the rest of other nothern business mogul and political big shots have bulk of their investments in the south of Nigeria but some devious northern elite has chosen to covet this weakness of the misinformed northern masses as political pondits since that his all they have chosen to do with their own life to be so heavenly minded and earthly useless. Ola Rotimi has said it in his 1968 Play and his 1971 Novel that ""The gods are not to blame."" In this 21st Century, where the world is talking about the big picture and scientific research and industrial revolution and space exploration and nuclear armament for the fear of territorial invasion, an agenda in motion since as far back as the 50s, 60s and 70s, Here we are still bickering amongst ourselves in the name of Religion and little things. Sure every country has its own perculiar challenges but our case is far fartched unbefitten to be engaged with petty and primitive matters as such mob or public lynching in the name of Religion. Honestly I must confess,  forget all these unserious brandishing politicians and political party everywhere in Nigeria selling empty hands and pockets of air to the masses; we have no credible leader yet in Nigeria who can salvage the reigns of this country as we really need to look both inward and outward going around the world window shopping for credible leaders regardless of country, color or race or tribe because what I see before me is more than what my mouth and stomach can carry and its by far worse than the calamity that has befallen Ukraine that warranted the shelling and an Exodus from their land. As Nigerians, we have for too long made a big fool of ourselves amongst the committee of nations that we are now hunted home and abroad and amongst our fellow tribal and natives and fellow Nigerians let alone from the rest of Africa and the larger global community. This to me is called a living hell and we continue to allow our crazy leaders to continue to play partisanship politics with the fabrics of our life and future generation. Till date, I am yet to see any tangible structure in place about the future of this my great country we have rubished with our hands. We have in a short time gone from top and choice tourism destination to terrorism destination. I really dont blame any foreigner or any oyinbo or white fellas with the way they treat us all over the world, I am in support that the discrimination and loathing should continue until we all come to our right senses. When I heard #100 million naira for Presidential party ticket I was like #100 million naira for national campaign or for national funeral or what?? This is a broad daylight rape of the image of the Nigerian masses and come the time for election we would stupidly go and vote this E goats and slowpoke mocking us and we would be expecting a miraculous change to happen for Nigeria to be made a Paradise in 1 to 4yrs? Sure Nigeria need no rocket science to fix it just like some Asian countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia went headlong into transfer technology in the 60s and 70s since they know it is useless to reinvent the wheel instead of upgrading what has been provided.  In fact for everyone of us in Nigeria, corruption has caught up with us all wether we are actively or passively an accomplice, wether your a beneficiary or a silent on the fence observer.. The koboko wey they wait us will find us any where we are or run to wether inside the well, wether your in Nigeria or you run to USA, UK, Norway, Ukraine, Russia, Canada, Germany, Lithuania, Estonia, Bosnia, Croatia, Singapore, Malaysia, Qatar, Bahrain, Dubai, France, Brazil, Mauritius, Comoros, any where you go hide or you enter, your own koboko dey wait you for front so I swaer. The same way the Isrealis suffered persecution for centuries even till date until they choose to get things right. As Nigerians, a people and a community, our body language and social vibe is becoming more and more dangerous and suicidal every passing day as most of us have too many untamed demons and grievances that has reduced or relegated us towards having our cerebrals in our genitals and under the soul of our feet and these dastardly tendencies and bad vibes speaks volume in us, amongst us and all over us and our way of life",Curbing Religious Intolerance In The Bud.

447,"Nigeria’s blasphemy laws are the religious freedom crisis no one is talking aboutThis op-ed was originally published by Religion News Service, on February 5, 2021. By USCIRF Vice Chair Tony Perkins and Commissioner Frederick A. Davie. Last year, a Shariah court in northern Nigeria condemned Yahaya Sharif-Aminu, a 22-year-old Muslim gospel musician, to death for committing blasphemy in a series of private WhatsApp messages. The same court found a 16-year-old boy, Umar Farouk, guilty of blasphemy for reportedly insulting the Prophet Muhammad while arguing with a friend and sentenced him to 10 years in prison with manual labor.Farouk’s sentence has been overturned, and Sharif-Aminu’s case has been sent for retrial. But these harsh sentences are only the latest examples of the problematic application of Shariah law in some states in northern Nigeria, and they remain sources of concern.Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa, is almost evenly split between Muslims and Christians. Despite its religious diversity, many Nigerians face systematic threats to their right to freedom of belief. Boko Haram jihadists and other armed insurgents frequently attack houses of worship and religious ceremonies and regularly abduct and execute civilians based on their beliefs.But nonstate actors like Boko Haram are not the only threat.Since 1999, 12 states in northern Nigeria have adopted Shariah penal codes that operate parallel to secular and customary courts. In deference to the country’s constitution, which protects Nigerians’ right to freedom of religion and belief, the penal codes do not apply to non-Muslims and exclude provisions against apostasy, which is typically punishable by death.Yet many Shariah laws in northern Nigeria continue to criminalize blasphemy and result in harsh punishments for blasphemers. Additionally, the Nigerian criminal code includes a penalty of up to two years’ imprisonment for insulting a person’s religion.Blasphemy laws promote intolerance, discrimination and violence against religious communities around the globe. Even before Sharif-Aminu had his day in court, a mob burned down his family home in retaliation for his comments and forced him into hiding. Lawyers filing appeals on behalf of Sharif-Aminu and Farouk have had to do so in secret for fear of violent retaliation.Recent blasphemy convictions in Kano State are particularly concerning in the context of the continued detention of prominent atheist activist Mubarak Bala. In April 2020, police arrested Bala for allegedly insulting the Prophet Muhammad in a Facebook post. He remains in detention without charge despite a Dec. 21 court order for his release.During Bala’s detention, Nigerian authorities restricted his access to his legal team and family. In July, his wife, who had recently given birth to a son, had to plead with the government for proof of life and for information on her husband’s whereabouts and wellbeing.Through the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom’s Religious Prisoners of Conscience Project, USCIRF is advocating on behalf of both Bala and Sharif-Aminu, urging their immediate and unconditional release.Blasphemy laws and harsh sentences cannot stand if Nigeria’s commitment to religious freedom is to be realized. In December, the U.S. Department of State designated Nigeria for the first time as a country of particular concern for engaging in and tolerating systematic, ongoing and egregious violations of international religious freedom. Nigeria is the first secular democracy to be labeled a country of particular concern.Repealing the blasphemy laws, which have deep local support in northern Nigeria, will not be easy. Efforts to repeal them, in fact, may backfire if they are perceived as “outsider” Christian or secular actors meddling in local affairs.Consequently, the U.S. government should incentivize the government of Nigeria to engage state and local actors in a political dialogue designed to align local justice mechanisms with the rights and protections provided by international law and the Nigerian Constitution.The United States should also urge the Nigerian government to provide stronger security for the lawyers working on blasphemy cases in areas where they are experiencing harassment and physical threats.Ultimately, every Nigerian citizen has the right to believe and worship as they choose, and that right should be protected equally for all Nigerians, regardless of their faith or creed.https://www.uscirf.gov/countries/nigeria/religion-news-service-nigerias-blasphemy-laws-are-religious-freedom-crisis-no-one",Nigeria’s Blasphemy Laws Are The Religious Freedom Crisis No One Talks About.

At some point, he stood in front of the camera, but later moved towards some of the victims who laid on the floor.Dressed in a blue jean and yellow top, a student of Kaduna State University among the victims, appealed to the government for rescue.“I’m speaking om behalf of the students here. Government should please hear our cry and come to our aid,” she said.A male voice asked, where are you schooling, to which she replied, “Kaduna State University.”Which course, the man asked further, and she replied, “Agriculture.”Another victim gave her name as Gladys Tony, saying she worked at Defence Industry Corporation of Nigeria.“What happened on Monday was needless if the government had listened and acceded to what the populace had been saying,” she said.Another victim simply identified himself as Adedeji said he was on his way to Kaduna for eye treatment when he was abducted, but he was not allowed to speak further before the camera rolled over to another person.Alwan Hassan, Acting Managing Director of the Bank of Agriculture, was also seen in the video. Hassan was released last week.In a video released on Wednesday, the armed men threatened to kill the passengers if the federal government did not meet their demands.The video, which was less then two minutes, had four of the bandits with Hassan.One of them, who spoke in Hausa, said the MD was released due to his age and in the spirit of Ramadan.“We are the group that kidnapped passengers on the train few days ago. Among them is this man that was pleading with us due to his old age and we felt pity on him due to the month of Ramadan, so, we want to give him back to his family.”“But the government should not misunderstand this, as it is a gesture we made because of the pity we had on him,” he had said.The bandits then asked the MD to make some remarks. Speaking briefly, Hassan said he was released out of pity.“I want to witness to everyone that they took pity on me due to my old age. I was told to go out but I want to assure everyone that I left huge number of people behind and they are in situation that requires help for them to be released fast. I hope that government will meet the head of this group to release as them as soon as possible,” he had said.The Federal Government has promised not to rest until the abducted victims were rescued.https://dailytrust.com/breaking-expatriates-spotted-as-terrorists-release-another-video-of-captured-train-passengers",Bandits Release Video Of Kidnapped Kaduna Train Victims

They are holding meetings and planning how to cause mayhem in Yoruba towns"" AOKOYA in a statement signed by Ahmed Akorede saidThe group said credible intelligence indicated that the rioters plan to use the Sokoto gory event to launch attacks on innocent people across Yorubaland.AOKOYA blamed the South West Governors for giving a blank ticket to Okada Riders from the Northern states who have invaded all Yoruba cities even when many Northern states have banned their operations.

The Special Envoy had intimated his host about the situation in his country, particularly how an insurgent group, “just like your Boko Haram here kills, maims and destroys.” He then appealed for “close collaboration on security, particularly the training of our forces, since you have experience in this area.”Albino Ayuel said South Sudan was keen on ending the insurgent activities, “hence this appeal to our big brother.”https://guardian.ng/news/insurgency-nigeria-ready-to-help-south-sudan-says-buhari/?utm_term=Autofeed&utm_medium=Social&Echobox=1652502285&utm_source=Facebook","Insurgency: Nigeria Ready To Help South Sudan, Says Buhari"

459,"Malami had in April declared interest in the Kebbi State governorship race.Nigeria's Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami, has pulled out of the Kebbi State governorship race, multiple sources told SaharaReporters on Friday.Malami had in April declared interest in the Kebbi State governorship race. He also distributed over 200 exotic vehicles to party members ahead of the governorship primary in the state. On Wednesday, he submitted his N50 million nomination form at the International Conference Centre.Several sources close to the minister said he withdrew from the race over fear that he may not get the ticket. There has been a cold political war between the incumbent governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu and the political arrowhead of Kebbi, Senator Adamu Alieru over who succeeds the former.While Bagudu, who chairs the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), is rooting for Malami as his successor, Aliero, a two-term governor of the state, has Senate Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi as his preferred candidate for the APC governorship ticket.Aliero’s camp has Bala Sani Kangiwa, who was removed during the last state congress of the party as their chairman, while the camp of the governor has Abubakar Kana Zuru as chairman.Two secretariats of the APC now exist in Birnin Kebbi, the state capital. Fearing he may not get the ticket under the current circumstances, Malami was said to have changed his plan and pulled out of the governorship race. “He (Malami) actually pulled out of the race because he knows he can’t win without being the Attorney General,” a source told SaharaReporters.Malami, a lawyer from Kebbi State who was hardly known before 2015 when he was appointed into the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, is today one of the richest men in Nigeria. In 2020, a series of detailed investigations carried out by SaharaReporters showed that Malami had acquired several properties whose value run into many billions of naira since being appointed into the administration of President Buhari as Nigeria’s chief law officer. For example, the AGF has an underground hotel in Sokoto, three houses at Peace Estate, Abuja, a brand-new state-of-the-art school in Kebbi, two houses for his sons worth N100 million each and a new hotel under construction in the Jabi area of Abuja. Malami also bought a house worth N150 million in the Gwarimpa area of Abuja. A school located at the back of NITEL in Gesse Phase 1, Birnin Kebbi and a house worth N600 million on Ahmadu Bello Way, Nasarawa GRA, Kano, are among properties acquired by Malami since he became a minister under President Buhari. The houses he built for his sons in Kebbi are 200 metres apart in a posh part of the city. That is not all. Malami also built N3billion multipurpose event centre in Kebbi State named Azbir Arena, for his son. The facility is said to be an entertainment centre with a plaza and a kids’ playing section. This is apart from Rayhaan Hotel located on Zaria Road, opposite Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, which the AGF massively upgraded using unexplained wealth.http://saharareporters.com/2022/05/13/breaking-malami-withdraws-kebbi-governorship-remain-nigerias-justice-minister-attorney","Malami Withdraws From Kebbi Governorship, To Remain As AGF"
460,"Currently in Africa, several countries have fully legalized the cultivation, sale and export of marijuana, industrial hemp, or both, and in the process, planted the seeds of multi-billion dollar business empires.  In Ghana, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Lesotho and Zambia, legislative amendments have decriminalized cannabis cultivation, thereby establishing fertile ground for both regional and foreign investors to converge in Africa, breathing new life into African economies at a time when many are struggling to break even.The market in high grade marijuana seeds alone, rakes in massive revenue throughout Europe, with a single cannabis seed often selling online for as much as 15 US dollars, equaling 5 THOUSAND naira, for ONE single seed.  On this basis therefore, a single cannabis plant can generate MILLIONS of naira derived from seed production alone, provided that the genetics of the plant have been carefully developed for high potency, flavor, and medicinal value.A typical seller of marijuana seeds in the UK is Dr. Chronic, whose website is as follows   https://www.drchronic.com/products?utf8=%E2%9C%93&keywords=lemonCheck out this website and note the astronomical prices being demanded for SINGLE cannabis seeds, in order to fathom the gigantic economic potential of  medical cannabis production in Africa, where abundant sunshine assures THREE cannabis growing seasons per year, as opposed to ONE growing season enjoyed in Europe and the USA.Ghana was the most recent African nation to legalize medical cannabis production and export, and that landmark legislation was passed amid the confusion and upheaval of the Corona Virus pandemic, perhaps intentionally, so that the new law would fly under the radar and face less opposition than would have been the case under normal circumstances.The devastating economic effects of the Corona virus are going to be felt around the world for many years to come, by ALL nations, therefore it is more important than ever for African nations like Nigeria to chart a course towards speedy economic recovery, that can help their citizens get back on their feet when the virus tidal wave that is sweeping our fragile planet,  eventually subsides.With the foregoing blueprint for economic recovery in mind, this writer hereby appeals to Nigeria's lawmakers, many of who secretly consume high grade cannabis in the privacy of their homes, to place Nigeria on a solid footing to generate massive wealth in the booming medical cannabis industry, by passing legislature aimed at FINALLY legalizing this healing plant that contains such a wide variety of naturally beneficial components just waiting to be exploited for the creation of financial EMPIRES, in Nigeria.",Legal Cannabis In Nigeria Will Create Many Overnight Millionaires

470,"The Senate has continued to receive bashing for   the Terrorism (Prevention) Act 2013 (Amendment) Bill, 2022 it passed into law on April 27.The said law makes it an offence for kidnapped victims or their relatives to pay ransom to their abductors.The Senate claimed that the law will “prevent terrorist groups from laundering money.”Before its passage, the bill received an overwhelming support from the senators. The Senate President, Ahmad Lawan believes that the new law can “turn around not only the security situation in Nigeria, but even the economic fortunes of our country.” But Nigerians – activists, the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), socio-cultural organisations, among others – have continued to see things differently.In their latest reactions, a cross section of lawyers, former legislators and social commentators said that the law is uncalled for. Perspectives to the law  Providing an insight, a lawyer, Dennis Azeke, noted that “by the time you keep throwing money at kidnappers, the ill will continue to blossom. It becomes a bigger industry for the criminals. Worldwide, responsible countries have known this. So, some have legislated on it.“The US has the executive order discouraging payment of ransom.“But the government still uses its agencies like the FBI to find a way to negotiate with terrorists and meet their demands – especially when they cannot find a way to rescue their kidnapped citizens, whether they are held by kidnappers for money or for political reasons. “But in our case, the idea is to make payment of ransom non-lucrative for the kidnappers.“But practically, is it workable in the Nigerian set up? The question again is do we have the instrumentality to enforce the law we are talking about? The answer is no.“For those in government, when their top persons are kidnapped, they still use third parties to pay ransom.”Spirit and morality of lawMeanwhile, Azeke and Yusufu Alli (SAN) have been reflecting on the morality or otherwise of the law.According to Azeke, “the idea of the law is that kidnapping is illegal and not permissible.“Therefore, we cannot be talking about morality here.”He admitted that law and morality can meet and can also diverge. “But what is moral, might be legal, and what is legal might not be moral.”In his contention, Mr Alli noted that “there is nothing moral or immoral about the amended law.” To him, “it is simply a law.”He, however, expressed concern that the Senate had enacted a law that is non-implementable, cautioning that it is against the spirit of the law to have legislation “that will be hard to implement.”To buttress his point, he asked: “If someone is kidnapped, how do you monitor that ransom has been paid before the individual is released?”Azeke equally shared Alli’s view by declaring: “Yes, the law is good. But is it implementable; does it make any impact? The answer is no – because we have weak institutions, weak security agencies, weak judiciary agency – to enforce such a law.”He also raised other fears. “Now, when those who are to arrest the bandits – as we are hearing recently – are part of the terrorists helping them to push the kidnapping agenda, what faith do we have in those we are relying on to help push this law?”Ex-NASS members dismiss lawFormer of House of Representatives member, Hon. Uche Onyeaguocha, said that the law is simply not enforceable.He is of the view that the government had failed to put measures in place to secure the release of kidnapped victims.“It is not whether the law is moral or not. The law is not enforceable especially in a country where the government has collapsed.“How can such a law be enforced when the state is incapable of providing security for its citizens? What have they put in place to secure the release of kidnapped victims?” Not done he added: “Look at a situation where you cannot secure the release of kidnapped victims who have been held for years, and you turn around to pass a law that now, nobody should pay ransom to kidnappers?” Onyeaguocha  who is the erstwhile Secretary to the Imo State Government under the administration of Rt. Hon. Emeka Ihedioha also said: “It is, therefore, not the business of the government to bother any family that has the means and ways to secure the release of their kidnapped relatives, especially where the government has (been) literally ineffective and inefficient. “We have a failed system; so Nigerians are fending for themselves and taking care of their security.“Every individual today is almost a local government (of their own). You build your own house; you provide your own water,   electricity and even road to your house. So, tell me, what else does the government do? They are not building schools; they are not building hospitals. Who are they to pass such law?”Also, Bosun Oladele, a former House member who represented Irepo/Olorunsogo/Orelope Federal Constituency in Oyo State between 2015 and 2019, welcomed the amendment. However, Oladele, a former Commissioner for Information in Oyo State, noted that “the payment of ransom has its advantages and its disadvantages.According to him, there is nothing bad at all in making any law for the good of the people.“But one challenge we always have, especially in Nigeria is the implementation and enforcement of such a law.“Most of the people that have been kidnapped so far – except some – ransom had been the most potent solution for the release of such persons. “If families and associates will not pay ransom again, it will mean that technology has to be deployed to the highest level to make it impossible for them not to be kidnapped.“Until that is done, it will be very difficult to criminalise payment of ransom. “But the law is good because any law that is made will not just take care of the present, it will also take care of the future. So, as we are working on our security system, and technology for security purposes, we should also make laws that will assist the enforcement of security.”Meanwhile, a former Commissioner for Information and Culture in Niger State, and chieftain of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Jonathan Vatsa, has lambasted the Senate for the passage of the bill, describing it as “dead on arrival.”“This is yet another very unpopular bill like the hate speech bill which died even before it was conceived.“You don’t sit in an air-conditioned office and pass a law that has no meaning to Nigerians whose relations are languishing in kidnappers’ den,” he said.  The former publicity secretary of the APC in Niger State pointed out that it is highly regrettable that the senators who are the representatives of the Nigerian people could be thinking differently from what Nigerians really want from them, wondering whether they will not pay the ransom if their relations are kidnapped today.He asked: “Since Nigerians are being kidnapped, how many of them have the security agents rescued? The situation has been either you pay or you lose your relations because nobody will rescue them and our senators know this too well.“People are being kidnapped on the highways, and in their homes without any resistance from the security agents, and Nigerians are aware of this. And now, you are bringing a law that they should not pay ransom to secure the release of their loved ones?”To underline his argument, he recalled that “today, we have over 2,000 Nigerians in captivity, including students and new born babies born in kidnappers’ den few days ago. Yet the government is only there issuing directives to security agents without any action.“The victims of the Abuja-Kaduna train attack have spent over one month in the kidnappers’ den within Nigerian territory, yet, there is no effort to secure their release by the government, and yet they are here telling Nigerians that payment of ransom is prohibited.” Weighing in on the law, ace journalist and public affairs commentator, Kanayo Esinulo, described it as “terrible.” “I have never seen such level of nonsensical idiocy before. “The Senate should rather stop the killings, the kidnapping, the banditry – at source. Not when my relative is held, and there is the resource to bail him out. Or I can borrow to do that, and you say oo, don’t borrow, you will be offending the law. That is abominable. That is questionable,” he fumed.  He lamented that the action of those in government “has destroyed Nigeria, declaring: “The country is on the ground; we are just pretending.” Law not what Nigerians want Vasta told our correspondent that the Senate ought to know that the amended law is not what Nigerians want as part of their contributions to the fight against the current spate of insecurity in the country.“How many of our senators, especially those of them from the North can confidently go to their constituencies even with security?“Why can’t they pass a bill making kidnapping itself a capital punishment? That is when Nigerians will take them seriously. “You don’t fight a problem without addressing its root cause.“This is one bill that will have no meaning to Nigerians; in fact, they should not even count it among the bills passed by this 9th Senate.”What amended law portendsAccording to Esinulo, criminalising people for paying ransom clearly suggests that Nigeria is in deep crisis.“What it means is that the country is in chaos; there is anarchy in the land; and I think some people are trying to rope all of us into this.“I have never seen this level of funny thinking before. Such law, to say the least, lacks deep thinking. It shows that the leadership of Nigeria does not reflect the realities on the ground. It is low,” he argued. He expressed fear that anarchy, which is clearly ruling the land at the moment, is not being addressed scientifically.“Now, look at this. How do you rehabilitate and integrate a Boko Haram or bandit of yesterday into the army? Someone who only three days ago was fighting the army he is being integrated into it? It shows you the level of thinking of the Nigerian political leadership. It shows you that we have lost everything.“Whether you are going to rehabilitate those that have been released or you are going to arrest those that produced the funds that facilitated those that have been released, one thing is clear to me as a Nigerian, as a person, a journalist: there should be a total reorganisation or total abandonment of the present 1999 Constitution.“The fundamental problem of Nigeria is not the payment of ransom. It is not the enactment of a law in the Senate against those who pay ransom or the consequences that await those who pay. No! The problem with Nigeria starts and ends with the present constitution written by a certain Prof Angulu, which is not people-orientated – which did not attract the participation of the people.“It was the fault of retired General Abdulsalami who fetched Angulu, and gave him some pieces of paper to write a constitution and say ‘we the people of Nigeria,’ when did we do that?“There is the fundamental question of who will be arrested after paying ransom or people who will be held responsible for banditry. It is a matter that could be debated till the end of time.“The most problematic situation in Nigerian facing and demanding the attention of patriots and not pretenders is the total abrogation of the present constitution.”For Alli, the amended law “shows that as a matter of fact, if we have been up and doing, and our security system up to the task, we should not be talking about paying ransom to kidnappers.“By paying ransom, we are elevating kidnapping to a trade which is a big shame. But we have started. So, I think we should first of all stem the occurrence of kidnapping, and by the time it is no longer becoming rampant, we can now begin to talk about discouraging ransom payment. And by so doing, the actors will now know that it is no longer financially viable.”What Senate should have done Hon. Onyeaguocha is of the view that the Senate “should have first put measures in place so that whatever is fuelling the insecurity is tackled by creating jobs and providing the security agents starting with the police with the necessary equipment and training.”Alli equally reasoned that “rather than dissipating energy on this, Senate should have focused its attention on how to secure lives and property by ensuring that our security has what it takes to tackle the myriad of challenges they have.”Then he added: “I think when that bill becomes law, it will be interesting to see how it will be enforced.”Toeing the same line, Azeke believes the Senate did not do justice to the law.“What the Senate should have done,” he insisted, “is to find a way of advising on strengthening our security agencies.“In fact, before you pass this kind of legislation, there should have been a stakeholders’ meeting at which participants would proffer advice.” He reasoned that it ought to have been appropriate to give less punishment to the ransom giver,  saying: “You can criminalise ransom payment, but recommend lesser punishment for the giver lesser. Punishment for persons who demanded money and their associates should be stricter.“Besides, the Senate should have passed appropriate laws on how the institutions should he strengthened. Because the same  institution you are relying on are the front runners in this criminality going on in the country.”  Ordinary man and the law",Senate: Disagreement Trails Law Against Kidnap Payment

478,"The APC in Benue Zone C recently witnessed the arrival of a young man called Philip Agbese into the party with the ambition of representing the Constituency at the Green Chamber of the National Assembly. The self acclaimed philanthropist who is yet to say what he does for a living, has since his arrival into the Enone politics become the mastermind of politics of bitterness and blackmail in the constituency.Philip Agbese who gave himself the title Okanga 1 of Agila Land in Benue state has on many occasions lied that he’s a British lawyer but unknown to his unsuspecting people, he has never been to the British law school before not to talk of having any certification of attendance as revealed by our independent investigation.Further investigation about this self acclaimed British lawyer reveals that Philip Agbese has a gang of young yahoo boys around him who he uses as cover for his media business.He is alleged to be a kingpin, notorious blackmailer, who is a specialist in mobilizing social media hoodlums to attack any government official who refuses to fall for his blackmail to pay him off.One of his victims among many is the minister of Special Duties and Inter-governmental Affairs, Senator George Akume, the former governor of Benue state.Recall that in 2013 Senator George Akume was notoriously blackmailed by Agbese who claimed that Akume had forged his academic credentials and used it to secure the governorship position in Benue and also used same forged credentials to win the election that brought him to the Senate.However, the former governor was able to clear his name after he tendered copies of his original credentials, which were attached to his statement of defense, in the suit filed by Philip Agbese who accused Akume of forging his certificate hence unqualified to stand for an election.Former deputy governor, Chief Steven Lawani was not left out of Agbese's blackmail game as he did all to blackmail him before his principal Gabriel Suswam the former governor of Benue state.Amazingly, today Agbese is all out again with his blackmail game, all in a bid to get the Enone house of Rep ticket of the APC to which the leaders of the party and delegates have outrightly rejected him even before the party primaries .Information available to us says that, Agbese whose frivolous attempt to blackmail Akume all to destroy his political career has also put plans in place to drag the minister should he not get the party ticket in few days as the party is set to go into the primaries.Finally, we wish to thank our leader and father, senator George Akume, minister of Special Duties and Inter-governmental Affairs for building a very strong leadership in the APC family in zone c and Benue at large.

479," IN RENEWED FIGHT AGAINST MONEY LAUNDERING, TERRORISM AND OTHER FINANCIAL CRIMES, PRESIDENT BUHARI SIGNS THREE BILLS INTO LAWPresident Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday in Abuja signed into law, three bills aimed at improving the anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing/proliferation financing framework in Nigeria.The bills are: the Money Laundering (Prevention and Prohibition) Bill, 2022, the Terrorism (Prevention and Prohibition) Bill, 2022, and the Proceeds of Crime (Recovery and Management) Bill, 2022.Speaking at a signing ceremony at the Council Chamber,  State House, the President described the bills as being in tandem with this administration’s commitment to fight corruption and illicit financing activities, as well as critical to the governance agenda and the development of Nigeria.""The new laws have provided enough punitive measures and containment strategies against abuses and compromises,"" he said, noting that the inadequacy of all the repealed Acts had impacted legal actions against offender.""We will not rest until we rid the nation of the menace of money laundering, terrorism, and other financial crimes,"" he added.President Buhari commended the National Assembly for their tenacity, courage and commitment in ensuring that Nigeria has put in place effective measures to address the menace of money laundering, terrorism, and terrorism financing.The President noted that the 9th National Assembly has proven to be patriotic, responsive, resourceful and industrious in its legislative assignments, recalling that on 14th January, 2022, he had sought expeditious passage of the said Bills.He lauded the Assembly under Senate President Ahmed Lawan and the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila and their colleagues for responding to his request, saying they “have certainly carved out a worthy legacy for themselves.""  On the importance of the legislations, the President said:""The signing of these Bills into law today not only strengthens the Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework in the Country, but addresses the deficiencies identified in Nigeria’s 2nd round of Mutual Evaluation as assessed by Inter-Governmental Action Group Against Money Laundering in West Africa on compliance with the Financial Action Task Force global standards.""Accordingly, the repeal of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2011 as amended and enactment of Money Laundering (Prevention and Prohibition) Act, 2022 provides comprehensive legal and Institutional Framework for the prevention and prohibition of money laundering in Nigeria and confers on the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, the legal status of the Special Control Unit Against Money Laundering.""The repeal of the Terrorism (Prevention) Act, 2011 as amended in 2013, and enactment of the Terrorism Prevention and Prohibition) Act, 2022 provides for the effective implementation of international instruments on the prevention and combating of terrorism and suppression of the financing of terrorism.""The enactment of the Proceeds of Crime (recovery and Management) Act, 2022 makes comprehensive provisions for the seizure, confiscation, forfeiture and management of properties derived from unlawful activity. ""President Buhari told the ceremony attended by the Senate President and other Senators, the Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, Heads of anti-corruption agencies, including ICPC and EFCC, that the executive arm of government ""carefully avoided creating another asset recovery and management agency with its cost implications in deference to government’s sensitivity to the rising cost of governance.""He explained that the new law mandates the creation of dedicated accounts for the proceeds of crime and other confiscated assets in order to enhance the accountability of the process:""I have therefore taken time to note the emphasis placed on collaboration, synergy and unification of strategies and measures to combat the scourge of Money Laundering and terrorism financing and proliferation financing in the Act. ""The primary objectives of these measures are to ensure effective, unified and comprehensive legal, regulatory and institutional framework for the implementation of the Acts.""This is profound and calls for coordinated responses to the challenges posed by the menace.  I therefore charge all relevant agencies to ensure effective implementation of these new laws. ""The robust frameworks diligently enshrined in the Acts can only serve useful purposes when every bit of them is enforced.""Stressing that the fight against corruption requires an “All of Government, All of Nation approach’’, the President affirmed that every Nigerian had a role to play to rid the country of corrupt practices.He commended the members of the National Action Task Force comprising several Ministries, Departments and Agencies of Government, noting that the bills are a clear demonstration of government functioning at its best with coordination, collaboration, and execution all towards a common goal. The President assured Nigerians that his administration will continue to do its best to secure the nation, adding that the bills signed into law represent not just legislative instruments but very significant governmental actions projecting courage, determination, and sincerity in tackling the menace of Money laundering, terrorism and other financial crimes.Femi AdesinaSpecial Adviser to the President(Media & Publicity)May 12, 2022https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1579185209131243&id=100011193364134&sfnsn=scwspwa","Buhari Signs Three Bills In Renewed Fight Against Money Laundering, Terrorism"
480,"Gubernatorial aspirants of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Enugu Senatorial 0 have told the Ikeoha campaign organization that there were no bandits or cultists in Enugu state.The aspirants were reacting to a press conference held in Abuja by the campaign organization, whose principal is senator Ike EkweremaduThe Ekweremadu campaign team had among other things alleged that the April 30 PDP ward Congress for three-man ad hoc delegates election held in the state was married by banditry, much violence and skewed against Ekweremadu.But the aspirants from Enugu East Senatorial district, represented by Denge Josef-Ken Onoh, in a statement, Friday evening, described all the allegations by the Ekweremadu campaigners as falsehood.The aspirants however noted that Ekweremadu was one of them whom they hold highly in esteem but stressed that the 2023 governorship in Enugu state has been unanimously zoned to their district and urged him to have faith in the peaceful electoral process.Onoh in the statement said: “This conference is a unification and a show of solidarity among ourselves to drive home the acceptability and agreement of the people of Enugu state on power rotation and zoning of the common political position of Governorship of the state. Our coming together is to stress our commitment to a peaceful transition process in the state and its dividends of good governance, security and welfare of the people of Enugu state, who are the ultimate beneficiaries of every good administration.“We wish to acknowledge the pragmatic leadership of the Governor of Enugu State, Rt. Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi has been doing all his best to position Enugu state as the most peaceful and secured state in the country, despite attempts by a few uncooperative ones to dress the state in bad stead. We are behind Governor Ugwuanyi in these trying times and wish him divine intervention in the process of the people of Enugu state to choose who becomes their next administrator after him. We pledge that we will support whoever will emerge as the candidate of the PDP in the process that has already started well on April 30 2022 with the successful conduct of three-man Ad hoc delegates held in all the 260 political wards of our dear state.“As you were all witnesses, the ward congress was conducted freely and fairly in all the wards of Enugu East senatorial district and to a larger extent in all the 260 wards of the state as was certified by the ward Congress committee sent to the state, except for one or two of complaints, as we learnt, and which is normal and sometimes unavoidable in political contests. We are happy that there was no causality, despite attempts by some disgruntled persons who have chosen not to abide by the popular decision for governorship zoning and rotation among the three senatorial components of the state.“We have been inundated by inquiries from outside the state, where a press conference was held, in clear neglect of you reputable and hardworking journalists in the state, whom we know had severed them with all you might, up to this time that they chose to make a volt face. However, in response to the inquiries and for posterity’s sake, we wish to make the following clarifications.“Enugu state is a peaceful state that had not been associated with banditry or cultism as the Ikeoha Campaign organization inferred. We are amazed that the Ikeoha campaign organization would describe all the local government council and PDP leaders in Aninri local government, where their principal comes from, as thugs, bandits and cultists. These are leaders whose principal was part of the election process and never described them as bandits until they chose to hold a parallel congress which they conducted in their private residences.“Security agents are saddled with the responsibility of tracking bandits and hoodlums as alleged by the campaign organization, and so we are miffed that instead of following the right path of reporting such cases to the appropriate authorities for investigation and action, they chose the media to ridicule the well-conducted exercise and paint Enugu state black.“We are in good stead with the principal of Ikeoha Campaign Organization, Distinguished Senator Ike Ekweremadu, who is one of us and who we revere so much in high esteem that we are not quite sure that the campaign organization had his authority to disseminate the falsehood it has circulated.“We and Ekweremadu share a very close affinity bond of friendship and commitment to the greater good of Enugu state and we urge him to unite with us to promote peace so as to ensure a peaceful democratic transition in Enugu state. In the spirit of brotherhood, we urge him to play politics without bitterness but toe the line of amicable settlement of any issue that may arise in the course of this transition.“The Governor of Enugu state is not a thug, neither does he support violence and has never demonstrated any form of violence against anybody. Under Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi’s watch as the leader of Enugu state, nobody has been meted with violence; rather freedom of speech has been enhanced in the state with level playing grounds.“In a nutshell, we urged the general public to disregard the false narrative of brigandage in Enugu state. It’s not true and not in the character of the Governor and good people of Enugu state who are working hard to ensure that there would be the most peaceful electoral transition process in the state.”https://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/05/we-dont-have-bandits-in-enugu-pdp-guber-aspirants-reply-ekweremadu/","We Don’t Have Bandits In Enugu, PDP Guber Aspirants Reply Ekweremadu"

482,"Frontline Aspirant to the office of National Welfare of Nigerian Bar Association, Ikechukwu Maximus Ugwuoke is making a case for the upgrade of the welfare of Legal Practitioners in the Nigeria Police Force. He argued that they deserve better welfare treatment in the Force than they have now. In a statement he made available to newsmen he said that during his consultations with Lawyers in the various branches of NBA in Lagos, Abuja and other places he has visited so far, he has realized that  lawyers in the Nigeria  police force are facing a very sorry situation in terms of their welfare and ranks. In his words, he said ""I was chocked to gather that some lawyers in the Police Force are still at the rank of Corporal or Sergeant or Inspector cadres which are third, fourth and fifth lowest rank in Nigeria Police in ascending order. I was also amazed that other professional like medical doctors are given the rank of Superintendent of Police (SP), which is the third rank in the Senior Officers Carde in ascending order, at the point of their entry. This situation should not be. The Bar Part 2 Programme, which is mandatory for Legal practitioners in Nigeria, is a post graduate course and legal practitioners in the Force should not be treated like this. This debased entry ranking or generally degrading ranking of legal practitioners in the Force reflects on their welfare package, recognition and remunerations as lawyers in the Force. The result of this is the lack of interest by legal practitioners to join the Force and a handful of those who have joined (some of whom I know) are resigning from the Force to join private practice and to pursue their careers elsewhere.” Ugwuoke maintained that there is no doubts that there is the need for NBA through its welfare body and drivers to engage Nigeria Police Force to upgrade the ranking and welfare of lawyers in the Force commensurate to their work, productivity and comparable to their other professional peers in the Force. He said that approach will reduce the dearth of legal practitioners in the Force and increase productivity of the entire Police Forces in terms of prosecution of cases in court. He pointed out that the degrading treatment to lawyers in the Force could be the cause of using non-lawyers police prosecutors in the trial of capital offenses in Magistrate courts and possibly one major reason for the holding charge in the criminal Justice system which has been used to remand many suspect in the awaiting trial of correctional facilities in Nigeria. According to him, ""Even when non-lawyer police prosecutors have good cases to present in court but had to face a legal practitioner on the defense side, your guess is as good as mine. All this makes it imperative that the welfare of lawyers in the Police Force need to be priotized and enhanced to encourage them to remain in the Force and deliver their services diligently. It is high time the Nigerian Bar Association which is the parent body that should advocates for the welfare of lawyers in Nigeria began to engage the Nigeria police force and the Police Service Commissions to enhance the welfare of Lawyers in the Police Force.

483," WHY PRESIDENT BUHARI LOVES DAVE UMAHIFor the second time in the life of this administration, President Muhammadu Buhari visited Ebonyi State last week, commissioned landmark projects, and equally passed the night. Rare, very rare on visits to States.The President has 36 Governors to relate with, and possibly contend with. Political party would not matter, as he is the father of all. And good fathers, they say, should not like a child more than the other. Even if they do, they should not show it, for the sake of domestic concord and amity.But I can wager that this President loves Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State. Why and how? We will come to that later.Landing at Akanu Ibiam International Airport in the Presidential jet Nigerian Air Force 001, we continued the trip to Ebonyi in helicopters. And we entered the State through Osborn La Palm Event Centre, Uburu, in Ohaozara Local Government Area, where the Governor hails from. The man has made sure that development reached his own very community, and copiously too.From there, we proceeded to the King David University of Medical Sciences, Uburu, built by the State Government. I had last December written on the state of the art university, with ultra-modern facilities. You wonder how a state like Ebonyi, not earning derivation from oil money, could put up such a showpiece. It is one of the wonders of David Umahi in Ebonyi.Very significant to me was something that happened as our convoy snaked its way towards the university. About five boys, most likely between ages 3 and 5, stood by the roadside, and were waving at us cheerily. Two of them didn’t wear knickers, and you could see their tiny ‘things’ peeping from in between their thighs. They didn’t care a hoot if anybody was looking at them. They were happy to see the motorcade, and nothing else mattered in the whole world. They kept waving delightfully till we went out of their sight.Childhood. Innocence. No bile, no guile, no malice. Those boys obviously knew nothing called Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). Nor do they know the Eastern Security Network (ESN). They were just creations of God with pure souls, no murderous inclinations, no corroding thoughts of marginalization, real or imagined.Oh, that mankind could return to the original way in which we were created. What Heaven this earth would be. Make me like a child again. Make me gentle and trusting. Let little children come unto me, for of such is the Kingdom of God. The world as God made it is one thing, and the world as man mars it is another thing. May those boys maintain the kind of heart they displayed, for life. Amen.In that neighborhood, President Buhari commissioned twin flyover bridges, 12 kilometers dualized Federal road from Mbu, Enugu State to Uburu, Ebonyi State. And then the eye-popping university building, facilities and equipment.Also inaugurated that day were the International Airport at Onueke, including the Airport lounge and five kilometers dualized road. Others were a new Governor’s Lodge, office complex for the Governor’s wife, Margaret Umahi International Market Complex, the wondrous Light Tunnel Flyover, and Ebonyi Shopping Mall, which compares with any other you see in other developed countries of the world.So delighted was President Buhari with all he saw, that he declared: “It has always been a pleasure coming to Ebonyi State. The last time I came was in 2017 in the 2nd quarter of the first tenure of Governor Umahi’s administration. I witnessed the commencement of mind blowing projects. I saw in Governor Umahi a strong desire to change the narrative of the State, and meet the aspirations of the founding fathers.”The President, at a State Banquet that night recalled that he was given two traditional titles in 2017. The Enyioha 1 of Ebonyi State, and Ochioha 1 of South East.On day two of the visit, President Buhari commissioned another befitting edifice, the new Executive Council Chambers, where he also held a meeting with illustrious leaders of the South East.Now, to the crux of the matter. Why does the President love this Governor, so much so that he has paid two State Visits, and passed the night at both times?Governor Umahi loves and serves his people, and that is evidenced in how he has changed the face and landscape of the State. Old, rustic Abakaliki has suddenly become like any other modern city of the world. President Buhari loves infrastructural development, as seen in roads, rail, bridges, airports, and many others round the country. He sees Umahi doing the same thing, and he just loves it. At the time Umahi was still in the opposition People’s Democratic Party, it didn’t stop the President loving him.Umahi is forthright. No beating about the bush. At a time he saw that it was more in the interest of his people and State to be in the party at the center, he joined the All Progressives Congress, APC.Said the President: “I am honored that in the life of my administration, Ebonyi State Government and her people made the right choice to join our progressive party, APC. I commend the Governor for the courage to join the party at the center, and for all his contributions in moving our nation forward.”For the courage he displays, the President loves Umahi.Another reason. For touching the lives of the people through his projects and policies. Hear the President again:“You have done your people proud. I am particularly amazed by the economic development records of the State under your administration, the wonderful network of roads, critical infrastructure and investment opportunities in the State. ..I commend the State for emerging as the second overall best in fiscal performance in Nigeria and for soaring high in fiscal discipline, transparency and accountability in the use of public resources.”Touch the lives of the people. Utilize their money and resources to improve their lot, and Buhari would love you. That is why he loves Umahi.Umahi got nearly everything he requested for. He asked the Federal Government to take over the University of Medical Sciences, the President acceded. He asked for assistance to buy Airport equipment, the President promised to look into it. He named a number of projects after a normally self-effacing President Buhari, whom I’ve seen turn down such requests, but the President said yes to Umahi. Greater love hath no man than this...At the meeting with leaders of the South East, two requests resonated. The release of leader of the outlawed IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu, and the ceding of power to the region, so that there could be a President of South East extraction in 2023.On the first request, the President maintained a position he had always upheld. The case was before the courts, and the onus was on the judiciary to adjudicate. The second request was purely political, and rested with the political parties, who would decide where their candidates for President came from.Serve the people selflessly. Touch their lives. Achieve results. Be accountable, transparent, make the best use of resources at your disposal. Be frank, sincere, truthful, having the courage of your conviction. And President Buhari would love you. That’s how it is with Governor Umahi.*Adesina is Special Adviser to President Buhari on Media and Publicityhttps://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=5053947294697570&id=100002470489894&sfnsn=scwspwa",Why Buhari Loves Dave Umahi - Femi Adesina
484,"The highest Ijaw socio-cultural organisation, the Ijaw National Congress (INC), yesterday announced its decision to withdraw the support for Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike in his presidential ambition.The INC, in a statement yesterday by a member of the National Representative Council (INC), Elder Christopher Abarowei, called on politicians who had declared support for Wike’s presidential ambition to withdrew it until he tenders an unreserved apology to the leadership of INC, Ijaw Youths Council (IYC) and the entire Ijaw nation.According to Abarowei, the office of the Governor of a state and President is supposed to be occupied by persons who are considered by those who voted them into office in the first place as being among the best in terms of their ability to manage success.He said: “There is a popular saying that you know a person better when you give him power.“Governor Nyesom Wike has not disappointed those who helped him to be governor as he has turned himself into a complete public nuisance with the way and manner he quickly insults people at the least provocation.“This drift into uncivilised and uncouth adventure by a state governor is in our opinion unacceptable, undeserving and outrightly condemnable.“The recent outburst in a church of all places by Governor Wike against the Ijaw National Congress (INC) and the Ijaw Youth Council (IYC) is a clear case of a man whose mental state has to be interrogated.“It is highly unacceptable for a man occupying the most exalted position of Governor of Rivers State to use derogatory words like ‘Thunder Fire You’ in a church that is supposed to be congregated by decent people and respected workers in the Lord’s vineyard.“This is a clear indication that the governor lacks the moral compass to manage a state not to talk of his delusional attempt to occupy the most exalted position in Nigeria.“How will he feel to ask for the votes of delegates of Ijaw extraction from Delta, Edo, Rivers and Delta states whom he wants thunder to fire?“Governor Wike should better still allow his aides to do what he is shamelessly doing now as the job of an attack dog does not in anyway fit into the job description of a state governor.“We wonder how comfortable this governor is with him having issues with almost everything around him except for his bloated ego.“There is a popular rule in boxing that requires a boxer with the longer reach and height to come down to the level of a shorter opponent to hit his target.“In the process, the shorter man has an advantage to hit the face of the taller opponent with ease. Wike should be knowledgeable enough to know that using gutter languages will force weaker opponents to dive into the gutters with him.”He said no governor of Ijaw extraction had ever insulted the Ikwerres the way Wike throws caution to the wind to insult Ijaws at random.He asked him to come down from his high horse and build some moral decency and desist forthwith from insulting Ijaw people as his becoming a governor was a function of some Ijaw persons lifting his head, legs and hands.Abarowei said his fellow Ikwerre brother, Chibuike Amaechi, the current Minister of Transportation, would have crushed him without the support of the Ijaws.https://thenationonlineng.net/inc-withdraws-support-for-wike-demands-apology-to-ijaw-nation/","INC Withdraws Support For Wike, Demands Apology To Ijaw Nation"

Their swift reaction to the situation clearly demonstrated the outrage of millions of Nigerians and also demonstrated the desire of everyone to ensure that the perpetrators are quickly apprehended and prosecuted. As the President said, there’s really no excuse for anyone to take the law into their own hands no matter the provocation, there are set processes for ensuring that we are able to redress whatever wrongs that are done against us.We must express our condolence to the family of the young lady Deborah Samuel.

489,"In February 2006, Florence Chukwu, an English teacher in Bauchi State seized the Koran of one of her students that was reading the Koran while the English class was in progress in order to ensure that the student concentrate during class. For this professional conduct, a Muslim Mob was incited against her. During the riot that ensued, Florence Chukwu was murdered as well as 20 other Christians.On 21st of March, 2007, a Muslim mob murdered one Mrs Christiana Oluwatoyin, a female teacher in Government Secondary School, Gombe. HER CRIME? She touched a bag allegedly containing  a  Koran, eventhough, she did not know that the bag contained a Koran. However, even without asking her, she was declared by the Muslim mob to have desecrated the Koran. Hence, Mrs Christiana Olwatoyin was murdered in cold blood.In July 2016, the wife of a Deeper Life pastor told a Muslim man praying right at the front of her shop to move away as he was obstructing her customers. It should be noted that the the pastor's wife had repeatedly told the said Muslim man not to pray at the the front of HER SHOP. However, for some strange reason, he persisted. On this particular day, the lady insisted that he should leave and for this, he accused her of blasphemy, incited a mob against her and murdered her.There are countless instances where these senseless riots and violence had been incited in Northern Nigeria.  Shall I reference the religious riots and killings that took place in the North Nigeria, simply because a white man in one of the Scandinavian countries drew a cartoon of the prophet or shall I talk about the religious riots and the death of more than 200 of fellow Nigerans because of an article written in This Day News Paper when Silver Bird wanted to host Miss World Beauty Pegeant in Abuja.Eventhough, I strongly condemn derogatory statements and jokes against the prophet as every reasonable person should, may I note that the responses of my Muslim countrymen engaged in this barbaric riots and murders be condemned and opposed especially, when compared with the responses of their Christian countrymen.For example, on 27th February, 2013, Nasir El-Rufai stated via Twitter thus: ""If Jesus criticizes Jonathan's govt, Maku/ Abati/ Okupe will say he (Jesus) slept with Mary Madgalene"" yet Christians kept the peace.During Easter of 2021,  the CEO of Serling Bank named  Abubakar Suleiman compared Jesus Christ to our local Agege Bread thus: ""AGEGE BREAD, HE ROSE"". The Christians' response to his comparison was captured in the Punch News Paper thus: ""AGREE BREAD ADVERT: YOUR SINS FORGIVEN,  CAN TELLS STERLING BANK"".This write-up is for two purposes, firstly, to beseech my Muslim colleagues on this platform, especially those from the North to speak up and condemn these barbaric, inhuman and unlawful killings and riots. Especially, in your religious forums where such are taught and encouraged. For I strongly believe that if these killings are to be stopped, enlightened minds such as you are, must be at the fore front of the discuss. Your Muslim brothers would rather listen to you on this matter than listen to a Christian. We all owe the duty of peace, law and order to our beloved nation Nigeria. Atiku Abubakar (Former VP) condemned the killing via Twitter and facebook, but immediately some youth in Sokoto State  declared that they will not vote for him for castigating their action, he deleted the post both on twitter and facebook unless you choose to believe his weak excuse. It should not be said that we turned our back to critical issues such as this for personal gains or politics.Secondly, if the report that the riotting youth of Sokoto were able to breach the perimeters of the Sultan's  palace, who condemned their action and as a result, the Sultan had to flee his palace in the company of security escort because of the violent youth. I am of the opinion that a sitting Governor or a President  maybe chased out of his state by these religious mobs if we do not nip these barbaric actions in the board. How did we become such a lawless nation? But then, are Islamic injunctions superior to the provisions of the constitution? Far from it.

They all urged him to run.“One of them specifically told him that it didn’t make sense travelling all over Africa settling disputes only to shy away from leadership responsibility in his home country.“Another reminded him of the implication of failing to put the experiences he garnered as a former Nigerian president and as a continental statesman to good use.”The former president is, however, yet to formally announce a decision on the matter.https://www.thecable.ng/jonathan-finally-joins-apc-heres-what-we-know-so-far/amp",Jonathan Finally Joins APC?

The Sultanate releasing a Press Release on the gruesome murder of Deborah Samuel by a murderous mob in Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto, is a step in the right direction.All violent mob actions and killings stand condemned. The Muslim Youths of Northern Nigeria should learn how to stage Peaceful protest. We can not continue like this.Prophet Muhammad (sa) is the ultimate role model in Islam and his actions and reactions should be our guide. Among the four (4) 'pious' Caliphs of Sunni Islam, one of them was notorious in telling the Prophet (sa) even on simple matters such phrases:""Let me kill him!""""Let me cut off his head!""Prophet Muhammad (sa) has NEVER assented to his request because that is a manifestation of violent extremism. What is suspicious of this his actions is that he has never accepted a duel to the death challenge on the Battlefield. No even once!Unfortunately, some of our Sunni Youths think such behavior should be the normal state. That is with every little alteration ""Cut off his head!"" ""Burn him alive!"". They ignorantly think that such clear manifestation of violent extremism is a sign of piety and bravery. This is wrong thought process.The role model of Muslims is Prophet Muhammad (sa) and not that Caliph. It is important to note that the bravest Companion of the Prophet (sa), his Cousin and Son-in-law, has never asked his permission to behead anybody and on all Battlefields he was the champion. This is what piety and bravery means.Having said this, I will advise the Sultan of Sokoto to lead a high powered delegation to visit the family of the murdered Deborah Samuel. Such gesture will go a long way in improving religious tolerance in the North and defeating the menace of violent extremism and lawlessness.It is important to note that what Deborah said was not blasphemy. She complained about posting religious stuffs in their class WhatsApp group. There was nowhere that the late Deborah Samuel insulted Prophet Muhammad (sa). Her gruesome murder stand condemned.On a final note, our heartfelt condolences to the family of Deborah Samuel! God give them the fortitude to bear this loss!

503,"•Say ‘no peace, progress in a country rooted in injustice'FORMER president, Olusegun Obasanjo, has restated his position that the South-East should be allowed to produce Nigeria’s President in 2023, insisting that it would ensure peace, justice, fairness and sustainable national development in the country.Similarly, former secretary to the Government of the Federation, Olu Falae, also threw his weight behind a South-East presidency, noting that it is the only zone that has not produced the president in recent times.Obasanjo, who addressed members of Political Action Committee, PAC, of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, who visited him at his Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library, Abeokuta, to solicit his support for the quest for a Nigerian President of South-East extraction, said the minimum Nigerians would accept is that the next president should come from the South.Ime Obi Ohanaeze Ndigbo, at its meeting, last week, mandated its president general and the secretary to constitute a political committee to go around the country to solicit support for a president from the South-East.The Ohanaeze team consists of Ambassador George Obiozor, the President General; Ambassador Okey Emuchay, the Secretary-General; former president generals of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Nnia Nwodo, and Gary Igariwey.Others are Professor Anya Anya, former Chairman, Police Service Commission, Simon Okeke, and Dr. Chiedozie Ogbonnia, the National Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze Ndigbo.“The next president of Nigeria must come from the South East. The least acceptable minimum is a president from the Southern part of Nigeria”, Obasanjo was quoted by Ohanaeze Ndigbo’s spokesman, Alex Ogbonnia, as saying.The former President, who commended Ohanaeze Ndigbo for demanding their rights, told the delegation that what he “owes Nigeria is sincerity, objectivity and guidance.”He maintained the need for morality, equity and justice in a multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-cultural country like Nigeria, warning that “it is inconceivable to have peace and progress in a country that is rooted in injustice.”Obasanjo said: “Federal character, rotation of power and such other measures are meant to help our nation-building process and more sure-footedly, move Nigeria forward” and warned that “riding over these measures rudely, shoddily and roughly cannot augur well for our nation-building process and progress.”In his remarks, Obiozor commended the former president for his unwavering commitment to peace and unity of Nigeria, saying that Obasanjo remains one of the strongest voices in Nigeria and one of the most respected Nigerians in the world because of his track records of accomplishments while his tenure lasted as the President of Nigeria.He commended him for his courage, sincerity, steadfastness and passion for justice, especially as it affects the Igbo and the future of Nigeria.For national unity, peace, it’s turn of S-East —FalaeAlso throwing his weight behind a South-East presidency, Falae, who spoke in an interview, said the region has not produced a president in recent times.The former Minister of Finance said: “I expect that the South East will have a fair chance to ask for the president of Nigeria because in recent times the president has not come from the South-East. I said in recent times.“For national unity and peace, yes, but the South East is not the only zone that has not produced the president in recent times. There are six zones now and in the recent past, the zones that have produced the president are the North-West, South-West and South-South.“The North-Central, North-East and South-East have not produced president in the recent times, so there are three that have equal rights to ask for it if we want to be fair“If we want to use North and South, then it’s two (North and South) I insist it must come from the South because the present president is from the North.“However, if we are talking of zones within the six geopolitical zones of Nigeria, then we cannot limit it. We must look at all the zones that have not produced the president.”https://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/05/2023-presidency-should-go-to-s-east-obasanjo-falae/","2023 Presidency Should Go To The South-East — Obasanjo, Falae"

506,"The Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG), on Thursday, lambasted members of Igbo Elders’ Consultative Forum (IECF) and other groups clamouring for the emergence of a president of South-East extraction, saying they are going about their agitation in a wrong manner.The CNG alleged that the Igbo elders constituted a serious security threat to the country, adding that their recent warning that any attempt to elude the South-East geopolitical zone of the presidency in 2023 would rupture Nigeria’s corporate existence betrayed their desperation. The Northern Coalition, therefore, called for the immediate arrest and prosecution of IECF members led by former Anambra governor, Chief Chukwuemeka Ezeife, for threatening the nation, its institutions and the people.CNG Spokesman, Abdulazeez Suleiman, while addressing journalists in Abuja, also knocked other Igbo leaders who, according to him, are thirsty for the zone to produce Nigeria’s next President for allegedly seeking to tamper with the nation’s criminal justice system by pressuring for the unconditional release of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. It would be recalled that there have been intense political posturing, permutations and fireworks, especially as the eight-year tenure of President Muhammadu Buhari, who is from the North-West, winds down.However, the clamour for an Igbo President has since resonated with some 18 months to the general elections, especially as the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, has been consistent in its demand for an Igbo President in 2023.But the CNG argued that the continued resort to attacks on agents and symbols of the Federal Government of Nigeria in the South-East have deepened the fears that the Igbo cannot and should never be trusted with presidential power and rendered their renewed desperation for the Igbo presidency suspect. Suleiman said, “The Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG), has taken stock of events in Nigeria, particularly in the past few months when our democracy, political unity and national security have come under serious scrutiny, noting especially, the unrelenting violent disturbances created around certain interests of the Igbo people.“This is confirmed by the utterances and actions of such Igbo leaders as the former Governor of Anambra State and Chairman of the Igbo Elders Consultative Forum, Chukwuemeka Ezeife, when he threatened the continued existence of Nigeria during a condolence visit paid to him by Igbo leaders of thought and traditional rulers on April 5, 2022.“Similarly, groups of Igbo leaders and elders have engaged in desperate covert and overt efforts to secure the unconditional release of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the IPOB terror group standing trial for crimes against the state.“As if these were not enough, same group of Igbo elders again recklessly issued a national security threat on May 4, 2022, that any attempt to elude the zone of the presidency in 2023 may rupture the existence of Nigeria as a corporate entity as well as aggravate crisis, conflicts, separatist demands and others.The CNG observes that the perpetrators of this senseless violence are relentlessly pursuing the agenda of destruction and collective mayhem, fervently hoping it will engulf the entire country and bring about another civil war and mass killings.“This has deepened the fears that the Igbo cannot and should never be trusted with presidential power and rendered their renewed desperation for the Igbo presidency suspect.“The foregoing observations have made it impossible for us to remain indifferent or silent in the face of such extreme provocations and insistent drive towards civil strife.“In the present circumstance, the CNG hereby declares the following definite stand: To declare that the Igbo as a people have by their serial atrocious actions inadvertently foreclosed every hope for the rest of us to continue coexisting with them as one nation.“To demand the immediate arrest and prosecution of all the Igbo leaders and elders involved in the desperation to tamper with the nation’s criminal justice system by pressuring for the unconditional release of terrorist leaders.“To demand the arrest and prosecution of all the Igbo leaders that openly threaten national security and corporate existence of the Nigerian nation in desperation for an Igbo presidency.“To take every political and legal measure to frustrate and resist the dangerous Igbo scheme to secure Nigeria’s presidency in 2023 or anytime in the future, including: warning any northern politician against picking any Igbo man from whatever part of Nigeria as running mate, and mobilising the North against supporting, participating, in or, in anyway romancing with any political party that fields a candidate of the South East or has any Igbo politician in a position of prominence.“To demand immediate resort to available decent and civilized means for the actualization of the final separation of the South-East from the rest of Nigeria in order to avoid the mishaps intended by the Igbo’s evil plans and avert unnecessary devastation on the entire country.“To demand relevant Nigerian authorities and international agencies to step in and support the pending court process seeking for a referendum that will finally separate the South East from Nigeria to prevent a descent into another civil war at this day and age, as well as forestall the mass killings, untold sufferings and atrocities intended by the Igbo.”Suleiman, however, maintained that the CNG would remain committed to the search for a Nigerian leader with the capacity, competence and credibility to be trusted and accepted by all Nigerians irrespective of his tribe, religious calling or regional background except of course, the Igbo and the South-East.“The CNG also recommits to the pursuit of a legal framework for the conduct and implementation of a general referendum to determine the status of the South-East or any enclave that wishes for self determination from Nigeria,” he addedhttps://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/05/2023-northern-groups-kick-against-igbo-presidency/",2023: Northern Groups Kick Against Igbo Presidency
507,"The said law makes it an offence for kidnapped victims or their relatives to pay ransom to their abductors.The Senate claimed that the law will “prevent terrorist groups from laundering money.”Before its passage, the bill received an overwhelming support from the senators. The Senate President, Ahmad Lawan believes that the new law can “turn around not only the security situation in Nigeria, but even the economic fortunes of our country.” But Nigerians – activists, the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), socio-cultural organisations, among others – have continued to see things differently.Perspectives to the law  Providing an insight, a lawyer, Dennis Azeke, noted that “by the time you keep throwing money at kidnappers, the ill will continue to blossom. It becomes a bigger industry for the criminals. Worldwide, responsible countries have known this. So, some have legislated on it.“The US has the executive order discouraging payment of ransom.“But the government still uses its agencies like the FBI to find a way to negotiate with terrorists and meet their demands – especially when they cannot find a way to rescue their kidnapped citizens, whether they are held by kidnappers for money or for political reasons. “But in our case, the idea is to make payment of ransom non-lucrative for the kidnappers.“But practically, is it workable in the Nigerian set up? The question again is do we have the instrumentality to enforce the law we are talking about? The answer is no.“For those in government, when their top persons are kidnapped, they still use third parties to pay ransom.”Spirit and morality of lawMeanwhile, Azeke and Yusufu Alli (SAN) have been reflecting on the morality or otherwise of the law.According to Azeke, “the idea of the law is that kidnapping is illegal and not permissible.“Therefore, we cannot be talking about morality here.”He admitted that law and morality can meet and can also diverge. “But what is moral, might be legal, and what is legal might not be moral.”In his contention, Mr Alli noted that “there is nothing moral or immoral about the amended law.” To him, “it is simply a law.”He, however, expressed concern that the Senate had enacted a law that is non-implementable, cautioning that it is against the spirit of the law to have legislation “that will be hard to implement.”To buttress his point, he asked: “If someone is kidnapped, how do you monitor that ransom has been paid before the individual is released?”Azeke equally shared Alli’s view by declaring: “Yes, the law is good. But is it implementable; does it make any impact? The answer is no – because we have weak institutions, weak security agencies, weak judiciary agency – to enforce such a law.”He also raised other fears. “Now, when those who are to arrest the bandits – as we are hearing recently – are part of the terrorists helping them to push the kidnapping agenda, what faith do we have in those we are relying on to help push this law?”But Is this really what Nigerians want",

509,"Deepening Democracy, No Anointed Aspirant in Niger State: The Exemplary Way of Abubakar Sani Bello.By Abdullberqy U Ebbo As the whole nation goes agog ahead of the 2023 general elections, political stakeholders are looking to secure their foot in new administrations by forging alliances. While these are all of different ideologies and diverse identities, they all have a thing in common: none of them wants to support a losing side.But there is no knowing what side is the winning one. But there are indicators. For example, one can guess considering where the support of the Governor of the ruling party lies. In niger state however, it’s a futile effort trying to guess where the Governor belongs because, in truth, he belongs to everybody and belongs to nobody. In a number of states across the country many Governors have anointed their chosen candidates, and all party members have been advised to work for the emergence of the chosen one in the primary and general elections.In Niger State, however, Governor Abu Sani Bello has refused to disrupt the level playing ground by anointing anybody, this is unprecedented in the history of our democracy, the Governor has remained neutral insisting that the will of the people must be allowed to excel. He maintained that, Nigerlites must be allowed to choose for themselves and the process of ensuring that cannot and should not be disrupted. Governor Abu Sani Bello will not impose anyone on the people of Niger state. A move that’s earning him love from political analysts and indeed Nigerlites. For Governor Bello, this has been a consistent behavior since he appeared in the political scene. His Excellency has never frustrated the democratic process by denying actors a level playing field nor the people their preferred choice. If anyone followed past elections in niger state under the supervision of Governor Abu Sani Bello, he or she should know the Governor is not in the business of imposing anyone on people. The last local government council elections clearly demonstrated that, no single Council Chairman or Councillor was anointed by the Governor. His choice is always the peoples’ choice. There are examples too many to mention where the Governor has maintained neutrality to ensure a level playing field. And as we are ready to go into the primaries, it appears Governor Abu Sani Bello would stay true to his resolve and further deepen the democratic process of the APC in Niger State by setting a beautiful example of how a leader should be.Cc: Lalasticlala, mynd44","Deepening Democracy, No Anointed Aspirant In Niger State:"

For these years, I have served as vice president and acting president.” I have also worked under a very open and transparent President who has given me every opportunities to understand some of the issues and challenges that affect a country of a size and diversity like Nigeria.” So I have all these opportunities and I most say that having had those opportunities and when the time for people to put themselves forward to run as president, I believe it will be irresponsible of me after seven years, not join the race.” So, among the aspirants I am the most with the experience and knowledge at the federal level to do this job and we will hit the ground running from day one, God willing.” The time has come for me to put myself for the task ahead and I must add that my sole objective is to serve this country and the people, that is the reason why I am here in Ekiti to consult with the stakeholders and of course the party delegates.”He commended the traditional ruler for his fatherly advice and efforts at ensuring peace and stability in the community , noting that his visit to the palace was heartwarming and treasurable.Responding, Oba Adejugbe who eulogised the vice president for his contributions to the development of the country in the last seven years, disclosing that he has the needed qualities to be president.Ewi who prayed for him on his aspiration, said, ” the next president should remember the traditional institutions for critical roles in nation building rather than advisory or visitations during elections every four years.”https://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/05/2023-im-most-experienced-to-tackle-nations-myriad-problems-osinbajo/",2023: I’m Most Experienced To Tackle Nation’s Myriad Problems — Osinbajo

The students banded together with miscreants and barricaded the Sokoto/Jega road,” the PPRO had said in a statement.“Two students were arrested in connection with the crime committed. The school has been closed down by the school authority, and policemen were deployed to give tight security coverage,” Abubakar had added.Many civil society groups and lawyers have condemned the murder of Deborah while some persons have defended the mob action.Sokoto, a state in Nigeria’s North-West has a more Muslim population than Christians and there have been cases of sectarian strife and religion-triggered extrajudicial killings.https://punchng.com/blasphemy-youths-plan-protest-in-sokoto-demand-release-of-suspects/?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1652528015-1","[JUST IN] Blasphemy: Youths Plan Protest In Sokoto, Demand Release Of Suspects"
522,"Good morning all.We all know about the happening in Nigeria since the past few days, this incident has been a eye opener to many Nigerians especially the christians.Its a general belief that the Muslims are the majority in Nigeria, which I beg to disagree. Christians is the majority in Nigeria but the issue they have is they don't vote in unity in election unlike the Muslim fold that vote uniformly base on religion, region and directives from their imams, traditional and political elders. This is where the christians need to learn and vote in unity and uniformly.For example, in Nasarawa state, majority of the population are christians but a christian has never been the governor in that state because of disunity among the christians to vote a particular candidate.Few days ago, Abubakar Atiku deleted the post condemning the killing of Deborah Samuel in Sokoto, calling for the prosecution of the perpetrators, because he was threatened by the Muslim folds of their votes, he quickly ran to delete and denied authorizing the post. He has not condemn the said action. This mean three things: 1)  He prefered his presidential ambition than the life lost and he will surely play to the tune of the Muslims when he gets power.2) He has no regards for the christian community in Nigeria, his government which will never be will be worst than Buhari government in terms of bigotry and nepotism.3) He is selfish and not a true Leader.By this action, Abubakar Atiku have lost all the votes of the christians in Nigeria, let see how he will win the presidential election without the votes of christians. Any political party that field him will lost 2023 presidential election.Thank God, He has revealed who Abubakar Atiku really is and what he stands for.Christians, be wise.",Abubakar Atiku Has Lost 2023 Election

The other people in the street were acting like they just brought American president to their town, and what a beautiful scene to watchThis lady could be pregnant, they do not care, this lady is their classmate, someone they see everyday, and hear her voice, but still they felt no compassion throwing stones, like when children throw stones in the sky and feel happy it went up. If this is not Psychopathy, what is it?Pls read on PsychopathOnce again they tagged their behaviour Islam and defending the prophet. Their elders are fully in support of their actions, and member of Sokoto indigenes are jubiliating, right now, they are planning protest for arresting the killers of this lady. What religion have no Compassion except Psychopathy, its Simply satan worshiping, even Satan would have some emotions than these useless NorthernersMy question is who bear the brunt of their atrocities? We true MuslimsWe the true Muslims who actually do love holy prophet would have to watch member of the public for the next one week abusing the prophet, so many videos right now are circulating in mockery of the holy prophet and Muslims because of the satanic actions of Northerners that they tagged Islam. We will have to watch in PAINS, or how many people do you want to fight online?They wrote cancer law and tagged it Sharia law where they kill innocent people for expression of speech, even if someone abuse the prophet, why will you kill her? Is she using their mouth to abuse the holy prophet In ISLAM theres nothing like ""Blasphemy Punishment"", this was coined from the BIBLE by some Early Salafy and Sunni Muslim who were Christians and Jews and brought to IslamThe Quran clearly go against Punishment for Blasphemy and Allah sw made us known it is normal for prophets to be abused and ridiculed, and the Prophet in his lifetime was insulted, abused, mocked and he never told people to hurt anyone for it. Our holy prophet is better than any human being, so if you have compassion for the lady, do you think the holy prophet who is better than you, wont have compassion for the lady?Our real enemies are the Senseless Muslims in the North including SULTAN of Sokoto, who is a hypocrite. Northerners worship their Rich people and Leaders, all he had to do was publicly preach to thier senseless people to Not kill anyone for any reason, and this would end. All their Imams need to do is to Preach in their Mosque that No one should Kill anyone for any reason including mocking the prophet and this would stopBut they continue to preach that anyone that insults the prophet would be killed, thus people continue to take law into their handsThese people killing are animals, and thus they don't even understand why they should not kill, asking them to be arrested, is like asking a lion that killed a human being to be arrested, tomorrow some other set of animals will kill another human being and it will continue like thatStop fighting and trying to defend Islam, who you should face are the BAD MUSLIMS. The prophet won a lot of people to Islam with his behaviour, that is simple psychology. People will listen to your cued,actions more than your words, if you want people to believe Islam is peaceful, you need to show peace and be a good example, arguing with people that Islam means Peace when some idiots killed a human being for insulting prophet is like pouring water in a basket.

Julius Berger was thus commissioned to undertake the construction and extension of the existing motorway to the airport.The contract for a 26.5 km long section starting at ""City Gate"" and ending at ""Bill Clinton Drive"" included the extension of the existing connection to the airport from two to three lanes as well as the construction of a new parallel two-lane expressway in each direction. The connection of the new two-lane expressway to the extended 3-lane motorway is provided by connecting roads. In addition, river bridges, pedestrian bridges, flyovers and underpass bridges as well as bus stations and turning facilities were planned and built.Future developments such as the Kukwaba National Park was taken into account and incorporated into the design and throughout the construction process, the daily traffic continued along the existing dual carriageway while Julius Berger constructed the three new lanes. Once the construction had been concluded, the traffic was diverted onto the new carriageway, in order to complete the refurbishment of the existing dual carriageway.Throughout the whole project, the safety of road users as well as Julius Berger staff was highly prioritized.Lalasticlala",Abuja Airport Road Superhighway: GEJ's Unmatchable Imprint: Pictures & Video
528,"Human rights lawyer and Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Femi Falana, has faulted the withdrawal of the resignation letter by the Minister of Labour and Productivity, Chris Ngige, describing it as “illegal and unconstitutional”.The PUNCH reports that Ngige pulled out of the 2023 presidential race to retain his ministerial seat.The former governor of Anambra State and member of the All Progressives Congress made his withdrawal known in a statement on Friday.“Having also consulted widely with my family, constituents, supporters, and well-wishers, it is my pleasure to announce the withdrawal of my interest and earlier decision to contest the office of the President in the 2023 general elections.“As a result of this, will NOT be participating in any of the internal party processes of the said election, starting with the primary. I took this momentous decision firstly in the overall interest of the nation, in order to enable me to concentrate on my job, and assist the President and the Government, during the difficult last lap in the life of the administration, and secondly for other family reasons.“I have since communicated this decision to the President and the Secretary to the Government of the Federation,” he stated in a statement.But reacting to the development in a statement on Friday, Falana said such withdrawal from Ngige and reported withdrawal of the Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN, was illegal. According to him, the withdrawal constitutes a gross contravention of section 306 (2) of the Constitution.In a statement titled, ‘Withdrawal of resignation letters by former Ministers is illegal’,  he said, “Having resigned from the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.)’s  administration, Mr. Abubakar Malami, SAN, and Dr. Chris Ngige were reported to have withdrawn their letters of resignation after the farewell meeting.“Such withdrawal is illegal as it constitutes a gross contravention of section 306 (2) of the Constitution which stipulates that “The resignation of any person from any office established by this Constitution shall take effect when the writing signifying the resignation is received by the authority or person to whom it is addressed or by any person authorised by that authority or person to receive it.”“Since the resignation of the former Ministers has taken effect, they cannot return to the cabinet either on their own volition or on the directive of the President. The resignation of the Ministers is not a cabinet reshuffle. It is akin to the removal of the former Ministers by the President.“Therefore, if the former Ministers are going to be reappointed, the President is required by section 147 of the Constitution to submit names to the Senate for fresh screening and confirmation.”Source: https://punchng.com/Why-Ngige-other-ministers-cant-withdraw-resignation-SAN","Falana: Why Ngige, Other Ministers Can’t Withdraw Resignation"

534,"Emefiele: A Corrupt, Inept, Heart-Attack-Loving Presidential Wannabe- Farooq KperogiCentral Bank of Nigeria governor Godwin Emefiele embodies all that is wrong with Nigeria. He is infernally incompetent, exceptionally corrupt, mind-blowingly self-serving, incomprehensibly clueless, overweeningly ambitious, and cruelly insensitive. Yet he wants to be your next president—and remain your central bank governor while trying to do so.In response to questions from State House correspondents on Thursday about the propriety of running for president while still the Central Bank of Nigeria governor and the unease this has caused among most Nigerians, Emefiele said, “Let them [i.e., Nigerians who criticize him] have heart attack. It’s good to have [a] heart attack. I am having a lot of fun.”He isn’t a presidential nominee, much less a president, yet, but he is already deriving perverse joy from the possibility that Nigerians who question the correctitude of his choices would die of heart attack. He even said, “it’s good to have [a] heart attack” and that he is “having a lot of fun.”That’s a conscienceless murderer right there. It shows that the suffocating monetary policies he has been implementing, which have caused Nigeria to become the world’s poverty capital, deepened the misery of millions of Nigerians, and hastened the deaths of scores of people, are intentional. He wants to be president so he can have more unbridled power to take Nigeria to the depths of unheard-of despair and agony.Of course, it might be argued that Emefiele said what he said in a fit of irritation and didn’t literally mean that he wanted critics of his eccentric presidential run to have heart attacks. He, after all, has notoriety for sophomoric temper tantrums.For example, in a stunningly childish rage on September 17, 2021, Emefiele challenged UK-based AbokiFx owner Oniwinde Adedotun to “come out, let’s fight” because Emefiele thought the naira was losing ground against foreign currencies because the AbokiFx website published daily exchange rates that reflected the perilous state of the naira! The website has existed since 2014 and merely publishes fluctuations in the foreign exchange market.Does Nigeria deserve such an incompetent, emotionally damaged, intolerant, and infantile twit as president after Buhari? What kind of country would we have with a president who, in a fit of impotent anger, invites citizens less privileged than he is to a physical fight because he thinks they are responsible for the calamitous outcome of his incompetence?What kind of country would Nigeria be if it’s saddled with a childish president in the mold of Emefiele who has conniption fits when he’s challenged and who invokes death upon his critics? I leave that to Nigerians to chew over.If someone wrote a tragicomic drama script about Godwin Emefiele’s scandal-ridden reign as a central bank governor and his ludicrously insane attempts to run for president using the financial and symbolic resources of the central bank while still a central bank governor who hurls consequence-free insults and wishes death upon critics for calling attention to the manifest conflict of interest that his presidential run represents, literary critics would pillory the script for its implausible plot.Yet, we are witnessing in real life what would be unrealistic in the realm of fictional imagination.Emefiele is, without contest, the absolute worst central bank governor Nigeria has ever had. His insanely headless monetary policies have caused the unprecedented fall of the naira and the collapse of the economy.His monumental corruption is already well known. For example, TheCable of December 4, 2015, in an exclusive investigation titled “EXCLUSIVE: How CBN emptied its vaults to finance PDP’s presidential campaign,” uncovered that “The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) practically emptied its vaults apparently to finance the presidential campaign of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)…”Emefiele flouted existing anti-money laundering regulations in the country and “dole[d] out hundreds of millions of dollars in cash to various agencies in government in the run-up to the general election” so much so that after February 2015, “the CBN did not have any more dollars in its vaults. Even for estacode, CBN staff had to wait for dollars from the branches,” according to TheCable.His other scandalous transgressions as a CBN governor are also well-documented in other reports and are unworthy of recapitulation here. Many people had hoped that the change of government in 2015 would bring an end to his reign of ignominy and ineptitude.Curiously, Muhammadu Buhari retained him and even renewed his term, precisely because of the questionable deal he struck with the late Ismaila Isa Funtua and other members of the Aso Rock cabal.Not done with two disastrous reigns as a central bank governor, this degenerate, deeply flawed, ethically stained, immature twerp wants to be president. In doing so, he is circumventing age-old norms, violating existing laws, insulting the collective intelligence of the country, and perverting the most basic expectations of common decency.On Friday, Emefiele got a preposterous court judgement from Kwale, close to his hometown in Delta State, saying INEC should not stop him from running for president while he is still governor of the central bank where sensitive election materials are housed.What Emefiele did is called “forum shopping” in American legal terminology. It is the practice of taking cases to “plaintiff-friendly” courts that are guaranteed to give favorable judgement to the plaintiff. It’s dishonorable and condemnable.The Premium Times, in a deeply perceptive and insightful May 12 news analysis titled “ANALYSIS: Why Godwin Emefiele must be removed as Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria,” made a compelling case for why Emefiele running for president while he is a sitting governor of the central bank violates several laws.No forum-shopping, plaintiff-friendly judgment from Emefiele’s hometown high court judge can vitiate the fact of the illegality and indecency of what he is doing.Fortunately, as I am concluding this piece, BusinessDay reported that Emefiele has withdrawn his bid to run for president. I hope it’s true.The Murder of Deborah in SokotoI am glad that both the Sokoto State government and the Sultan of Sokoto have condemned the barbaric, coldblooded murder of Deborah Yakubu over blasphemy at the Shehu Shagari College of Education in Sokoto.I am also cautiously hopeful that their pledge to bring her murderers to justice won’t be the habitual safe, standard, prepackaged rhetorical frippery that our elites effortlessly regurgitate in moments like this. The punishment for murder in the Penal Code is death.The monstrous, bloodthirsty fanatics who took the law into their own hands and murdered Deborah should be publicly executed after a fair trial to serve as an example to other would-be holy murderers.For me, though, what is scarier than the unspeakably savage, extrajudicial murder of Deborah is the number of educated—or, more correctly, credentialled—people who exult in, defend, justify, and openly encourage her murder on social media.There are way more Abubakar Shekaus with high credentials than we care to admit. There are lots of respectable, well-dressed homicidal thugs minus opportunity running around in the country. Boko Haram isn't an aberration. It’s the logical outgrowth of a culture that valorizes mindless violence in the name of religion.But here’s a word for the deluded, bloodthirsty fanatics who bay for blood in the name of avenging blasphemy in Islam and who countenance the jungle justice inflicted on Deborah in Sokoto: there's no punishment for blasphemy in the Qur'an. Several scholars have affirmed this.If you derive the inspirational strength of your faith from the cold-blooded murder of people who hurt your emotions with their words, you're not a human; you're a wild, murderous beast!If we go by the logic of Muslims who get bent out of shape because of blasphemy, most of us Muslims would be guilty of blasphemy in Christianity, the other proselytizing faith in Nigeria. We routinely say Jesus isn't the son of God, that he’s merely a prophet of Allah. That's blasphemy in Christianity.We say Jesus wasn't crucified, which vitiates the core of the Christian faith. That's blasphemy in Christianity. We say the modern Bible is a corruption of the original one. That's blasphemy in Christianity.Christians would also be guilty of blasphemy in Judaism in several of their theological claims. And all Abrahamic faiths would be guilty of blasphemy in polytheistic faiths, including in traditional African religions. Should people die for every verbal indiscretion they utter that hurts our feelings? Where do we draw the line in a religiously plural society like Nigeria?https://dopereporters.com/emefiele-a-corrupt-inept-heart-attack-loving-presidential-wannabe-by-farooq-a-kperogi/","Emefiele: A Corrupt, Inept, Heart-attack-loving Presidential Wannabe- Kperogi"
535,".Say, ex-President best man for the jobOmeiza Ajayi, AbujaA group of Fulani herdsmen and ‘Almajiri’ on Monday night picked the All Progressives Congress APC Presidential Nomination and Expression of Interest forms for former President Goodluck Jonathan. Noting that Jonathan had a lot of initiatives for them, the group said the former president must be encouraged to come back and continue the good works he started for the Fulani.Spokesman of the group, Ibrahim Abdullahi said they decided to pick the forms in order to beat the APC deadline, not minding if the former president accepts them or not. Asked whether Jonathan is a member of the APC, he said; “yes, he is”.Addressing journalists, Abdullahi said; “I represent two of the most vulnerable communities in our country. The nomadic pastoralist and the Almajiri communities who have decided to purchase these forms for our former president, Dr Goodluck Ebele Jonathan to come back and rule this country and continue with the good work he has started. “You may recall that during Goodluck Jonathan’s era he was the first president since independence of Nigeria who had found it expedient, who was magnanimous enough some of us remember the Almajiri community, he brought a comprehensive policy of reformation and integration of the Almajiri into the mainstream educational system in Nigeria. “It was the dream and the vision of President Goodluck Jonathan that if that programme had continued it would one day produce from the Almajiri system of education; Doctors, engineers etc. Unfortunately, that programme was kept aside as soon as he left. Other parts of the community ( the vulnerable community) that Goodluck Jonathan wanted to really give a sense of belonging was the Fulani community, the nomadic pastoralist.“He set aside N60 billions in the coffers of the Central Bank of Nigeria which was to be used to develop livestock in Nigeria. I believe if government had continued with that programme, today, we would have been the Denmark, the Sweden, the Holland of the entire Africa in terms of livestock, in terms of beef and so on. Looking at this situation and of course the problems Nigeria today is facing, we believe that only a leader with that kind of patriotism, a leader with that kind of fairness who is ready to give every Nigerian sense of belonging, can be able to rule this country and that leader is Dr Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.“As you may have heard, a lot of interest groups have been coming out to urge him to contest but we felt that because of the deadline that was given whether he agrees or not we need to purchase this form.“Goodluck Jonathan is for all Nigeria. As Nigerians we believe he has interest of this country at heart, he will accept us. You can see that we are almost late to buy these forms, we have been trying with the Almajiri and the Fulani’s selling our cows. We were able to raise this money just yesterday and we decided to come and purchase these forms. Let Nigerians support this project.

You see I am a Fulani man, coming from the far north but I tell you there is no Nigerian today that I can cast my vote or campaign for except Jonathan.

538,"….says N100m nomination form aimed to exclude poor NigeriansBy Ikechukwu NnochiriThe Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Mathew Kukah, has warned that the 2023 general elections will not be free, fair or credible, unless those at the helm of affairs are able to create a sense of common citizenship among Nigerians.Bishop Kukah said he was concerned that the Nigerian population have been polarized, with most of the electorates deeply divided along ethnic and religious lines.Speaking at a national discourse that was organised to mark the 60th birthday of the Executive Director of the Policy and Legal Advocacy Center, PLAC, Mr. Clement Nwankwo, Bishop Kukah, maintained that dysfunctional system of governance in the country and failure of the state to fulfill its obligations to citizens, was responsible for the polarization.He said: “This is what the failuire of the state to live up to its obligation with the citizens has brought us to. So, when we are talking about citizenship participation in the democracy, what exactly are we talkng about because everything is still in the state of formation.“Now, I agree that the first thing to do is to look at what are really the obstacles to our developing a sense of citizenship because the first thing that all of us must agree on is that we still find the words of Awolowo being used to validate a sense of the fact that we are not Nigerians.“Awolowo said that Nigeria is a mere geographical expression. Awolowo said we were first Yorubas before we became Nigerians.“The truth of the matter is that countries live by the quality of mirths that they have constructed.“And if you don’t have a means of identity to who you are, not necessarily because you can explain these things anthropologically, but you must have something that holds you together beyond the constitution.“The constitution is a major instrument but if you now come to terms that between 1914, all the time up till today, we are still debating the quality of constitution that we have and there is a strong body of thought that is still arguing that this constitution is not our constitution because it said we the people and we were not there.“We shouldn’t have been having these conversations if we had agreed on the threshold of what constitutes citizenship, what the obligations of citizens really are and what is the obligation of the state to its citizens.“I make the point that the notion of citizens in Nigeria is still in suspended animation, in part, because all the simple basic things that we expect from a state are not there”.Decrying that religion and ethnicity “have become weaponized”, Bishop Kukah, said the country must find a neutralizing institution.Besides, he accused both the ruling All Progressive Congress, APC, and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, of using the high cost of nomination forms to sideline poor citizens from contesting for elective positions.He said: “People, now, can come to terms with the fact that it more important to look at yourself as an Igbo man, a Yoruba man or Ijaw man, rather than look at yourself as a Nigerian. And of course, when we talk about political processes, you are never going to have a free, fair or credible election until you fix the sense of common citizenship, and that is that all of us are aiming at the same goal.“Of course, the system we are running has forclosed the possibility because there is a lack of conscensual clarity.“Do we really understand what democracy is all about? There are other forms of government and indeed we opted for democracy because as Churchill said, it is the worst form of government apart from the others.“But right now as we know and are talking, even to declare interest in participating in this process despite the quality of your education, say maybe you went to Havard or you went to Yale, that is not enough in Nigeria.“This is what I have the ability to do, no, it is not accepted. So, if you cannot find a N100million or N50million to buy a form, or you don’t have the kind of friends who can buy it for you, I mean it is such a joke, that Nigerians are just sitting and we are just watching.“If someone has erected this barricade, saying that poor people do not have to apply, that is what he says irrespective of your qualification, then we should not pretend that we are running a democracy.“We should say that we are opting for plutocracy which is that only rich people can participate in the process.“But again, I don’t want to sound very dramatic, but I would have said why will Nigerians not go to headquarters of APC and PDP and all these parties and say we cannot afford this please.“But Nigerians as I said, we are conversing and drinking brandy and chatting and watching golf, watching tennis, Meanwhile, we have signed up to this reality”, he added.In her remarks at the event, a former member of the House of Representatives, Ms. Nnenna Ukeje, said it was unfortunate that only money bags could afford to contest election in the country.She noted that so far, most people that have been able to afford the exorbitant prices pegged for the purchase of nomination forms, are those that are presently occupying government offices.“What is happening is not a joke. The future of our country depends on what we do. It is our responsibility to challenge everything that is going wrong in our society and work to bring about a society that will work for all of us”, she added.On his part, Mr. Nwankwo, said there was need for Civil Society Organizations in the country to continue to speak up and to constantly hold the government accountable for the sake of the citizens.https://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/05/2023-therell-be-no-credible-election-unless-bishop-kukah/",2023: There’ll Be No Credible Election Unless … — Bishop Kukah

541,"One obvious thing about the outgoing governor of Lagos State Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode is that he is a lover of sports, especially football. You can't live in Lagos without being a sports person. In fact, one of the cardinal objectives of Governor Akinwunmi Ambode’s administration is Project T.H.E.S.E, an acronym which stands for Tourism, Hospitality, Entertainment and Sports for Excellence.Onikan Stadium is a popular stadium in Lagos state, it's a stadium which has played host to series of games across the length and breadth of the nation. The objective of the Lagos State Government is to turn the Onikan axis into world-class entertainment and tourism zone with special focus on sports and showcasing the rich cultural heritage of the State.The Onikan Stadium, located on Lagos Island close to Tafawa Balewa Square, was built in 1930.The stadium was formerly named King Geroge V before it was renamed Lagos City Stadium.The stadium was last renovated in the 1980s.The stadium is famous for being the home ground for top Nigerian clubs such as Stationery Stores FC, First Bank, and Julius Berger and has a sitting capacity of 5,000.The stadium also played host to the 1999 Youth World Cup, hosted by Nigeria.[img]https://1.bp..com/-HKNyuDwKPFE/XOZ3Oo9ehPI/AAAAAAAAbtQ/QLoFrTqwBpAnkzG_xpzVNXKn9Y-RSlyJwCLcBGAs/s1600/Onikan_Stadium_003_AutoReportNG.com.jpg[/img][img]https://4.bp..com/-vsZ-kyQBh-M/XOZ3SFo5PRI/AAAAAAAAbtY/obEz1yEaG30vfUci5QFcGeNXszKIAZ2CACLcBGAs/s1600/Onikan_Stadium_005_AutoReportNG.com.jpg[/img]The stadium which was meant to have been completed since January 2019 has faced lots of hiccups due to the political tussle the outgoing governor was going through. In March, we reported on the slow pace of work on this edifice as the contractor handling the project,  Slavabogu Nigeria Ltd seems lost as to what to do.When completed, the Onikan Stadium will be able to accommodate spectators of 5000 people and the edifice will accommodate up to 8,000 and 9, 000.AutoReportNG was in Onikan over the weekend and so far, the level of work on this edifice is encouraging.

The message was supposed to be delivered to Saudi officials through Iraq.“In fact, in addition to mastering military affairs, Soleimani was diligent in the field of diplomacy and peacekeeping, and in reducing tensions and expanding friendships in the region.“Unfortunately, the US government violated the national sovereignty of Iraq by assassinating a foreign official, within the sovereignty of Iraq, which is completely, an illegal act and in violation of international law and regulations.“The assassination of the counter-terrorism expert, General Soleimani, was no doubt meant to weaken Iran’s determination to rid the region of the artificial crises imposed on it by the United States and its allies.“But, instead of this dastardly act to weaken the Islamic Republic of Iran, it strengthened its resolve in the fight against this proxy army.” https://tribuneonlineng.com/iran-ready-to-help-nigeria-end-terrorism-%e2%80%95-ambassador/amp/LalasticlalaMynd44",Iran Ready To Help Nigeria End Terrorism ― Ambassador

551,"Former President Goodluck Jonathan has rejected some of the conditions given to him by members of the Aso Rock (Presidency) cabal to get the 2023 presidential automatic ticket of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), SaharaReporters has gathered. One of the conditions was that Jonathan must officially defect to the APC with some Peoples Democratic Party governors in the South-South and South-East regions.The cabal, comprising some members of President Muhammadu Buhari’s extended family and friends, are the powers behind the throne. This group is said to have the ear of the President, influence policy-making and determine those who get major appointments. Sources told SaharaReporters that the former President rejected the conditions and told the cabal he doesn’t have interest in the 2023 presidency again. His response, it was gathered, embarrassed the cabal members who described the former President as a traitor. “They are now accusing Jonathan of not fulfilling some of his promises after all the several meetings and soft-landing given to him. “He was to come on board by converting some PDP states in the South-South and South-East to APC, and that way he would get the automatic ticket uncontested. Some other conditions were also given to him. “But guess what? He told them he won't contest again. They are now angry, saying he was deceitful. They said after getting some of his seized monies back, his wife’s monies returned to him, he finally decided not to contest,” a top source told SaharaReporters on Thursday.SaharaReporters had reported that members of the ‘Aso Rock cabal’ had promised Jonathan the 2023 presidential ticket of the ruling APC. It was also reported that the cabal members had warned the President against handing over to the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo and Bola Tinubu, the national leader of the party. “Buhari’s cabal members have asked Jonathan to prepare for the party’s ticket. They said they don’t want Tinubu or Osibanjo,” a presidential source had told SaharaReporters.SaharaReporters earlier reported how the cabal had been pressuring Jonathan to defect to the APC.He was said to have surprised the northern elite and the cabal by his disposition to the Buhari presidency despite all the dirt and campaign of calumny thrown at him and the PDP before the 2015 presidential election, which gave Buhari an unprecedented victory over an incumbent. It was learnt that some cabal members had also been impressed that despite the Buhari government's glaring failure, Jonathan had not openly criticised his predecessor or his administration, much unlike ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo. Obasanjo had written open letters condemning the Buhari government and also verbally berated it at any opportunity. SaharaReporters learnt from sources that the establishment of 'Almajiri' schools by Jonathan to reduce a large number of out-of-school children in the North also scored the former president good points in the eyes of the northern cabal in the APC, especially with most of it now rotting away, even under a northerner as president.http://saharareporters.com/2022/03/31/exclusive-jonathan-rejects-aso-rock-cabal%E2%80%99s-conditions-getting-apc-automatic-presidential",Jonathan Rejects Cabal’s Conditions For Getting APC Presidential Ticket

Many people have been guessing the possible anointed candidate of the President or the cabal in the villa with the names kept changing among the candidates who bought the forms. President Muhammadu Buhari has some ministers like Rotimi Amaechi, Engr. Onu among others who are perceived to be very close to him and one of them may be the President's anointed candidate.However, lately, some Northern groups (allegedly sponsored by Muhammad Badaru, Jigawa State Governor who also bought the Presidential form) bought form for the Former President and the healthy relationship between the President and Jonathan in recent years has created suspicion in the minds of many people that Buhari may endorse the Ex-President.Yesterday, Hope Uzodinma and Buni submitted Dr. Ahmad Lawan's Presidential form which also redirected the minds of the keen followers of the APC events to start thinking that finally the anointed candidate is here due to the strong influence of Buni in the party and the role he played in restoring the party crises as caretaker Chairman of the party when Adams Oshiomole was removed until the recently conducted party's convention.

553,"The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Abiodun Alabi, has met with two factional transport leaders in the state: Musiliu Akinsanya popularly called MC Oluomo; and Azeez Abiola, aka Istijabah.In a statement on Monday by Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Benjamin Hundeyin, the CP warned that anyone person found causing trouble anywhere within the state would be arrested and made to face the law.The statement was titled, ‘NURTW Imbroglio: CP Alabi Reads Riot Act To Mischief Makers’.The CP noted that “the warning has become imperative following incessant clashes, fracas and malicious damage to property recently experienced in some parts of Lagos State mostly linked to the issues surrounding the management of motor parks within the state”.Alabi was said to have separately met MC Oluomo and Istijabah in his office where “he admonished them to prevail on their teeming followers to act within the confines of the law, is poised to ensure the security currently being enjoyed in Lagos State remains intact”.“In line with this stance, all Area Commanders, Divisional Police Officers and tactical commanders have been directed to deal decisively with anyone found instigating or causing a breach of peace within their respective areas of responsibility,” the statement added.The CP further assured Lagosians to go about their lawful duties without fear of harassment or intimidation. MC Oluomo, formerly the chairman of the Lagos State chapter of the National Union of Road Transport Workers, and now the chairman of the Lagos State Parks Committee, has been embroiled in a protracted conflict with Istijabah, the state chairman of the Tricycle Owners and Operators Association of Nigeria, an affiliate union of NURTW.The foot soldiers of the two transport leaders had clashed in parts of the state over the control of parks and ticket sales and lives have been reportedly lost while some persons have been injured.MC Oluomo had rejected Istijabah as TOOAN chairman in the state and the national body of NURTW in Abuja had suspended him (MC Oluomo) which led to his withdrawal from the union and the suspension of NURTW by the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu government.The governor subsequently appointed MC Oluomo as the parks management committee chairman despite public outrage and warnings of fresh violence.According to a 2021 report by the International Centre for Investigative Report, the Lagos chapter of NURTW generates about N123.08bn annually, which could service the annual budget of Nasarawa, Niger, and Yobe states put together.https://punchng.com/nurtw-crisis-lagos-cp-meets-mc-oluomo-istijabah-reads-riot-act/","NURTW Crisis: Lagos CP Meets MC Oluomo, Istijabah, Reads Riot Act"

555,"The sad news of murder of a student; Deborah Samuel of Shehu Sagari College of Education, Sokoto occupied Nigerian news space on May 12, 2022 and beyond. Rights and Freedom Advocates (RIFA) made frantic efforts to secure details of the incidence.It was discovered the girl was just a victim of uncontrolled mis-education and misconception. In a reported loose interpretation of the allegation against the victim, her alleged blasphemous statement was“This group chat was not created for you to be sending nonsense. It is for past questions, updates about tests or other school matters. Not for nonsense or some rubbish prophet”.This could literally be decoded to be her response to a student or some students’ social media platform post(s). To be sincere, most Nigerians are not different from their leaders who ignore ethics and rules to plunder the Nation into the current quagmire. Most fanatics and reckless group members often disobey social media group rules and regulations by engaging in reckless postings. RIFA in application of strict rules have had the cases of removing erred members but instead of some of them to be remorseful, they turned out to be more arrogant and recalcitrant. This was what the girl was trying to inculcate when she used what her assailants regarded as blasphemous words. This therefore calls for societal scrutiny.Even though the Sokoto Police Command made a release that two suspects have been arrested while the College authority also disclosed that the School has been shut indefinitely following protest that greeted the callous act, the required actions go beyond that.The society is now bedeviled with wrong education, ideology and wrong judgment. Nowadays, anyone even a lunatic can claim to be Prophet al beit that does not make him one. Similarly, most of the young ones have been indoctrinated to hate especially being the only message of most of the new generation religious practitioners.Therefore, the alleged girl statement to any normal human being constitutes not a reasonable blasphemy. Even if a blasphemy, not just ignorant people determine the blasphemous statements but those with vast knowledge. Nonetheless, everyone is urged to always take note of his environment before making statement.A captive in kidnappers' den risk dangerous consequences should he make provocative utterance. Even though Sokoto has been virus-inflicted with “Kukahtic” venoms which could not be tried by any stranger in the South East/ South-South regions where religious persecution is seen as statutory while same people would cry wolf when made to feel what they unjustly subject others, the Sokoto caliphate should not allow the warmongers achieve their aims of planting agents of darkness in their midst.In June 2018 an Imam; Abubakar Abdullahi saved hundreds of lives of non-Muslims in the North with only few people attributing that to his religion while in South East/ South-South the terrorists killing innocent people are of same faith. Yet no one blame their religion for that.Therefore, the Sokoto case was nothing but action of few misled ignoramuses who were not religious authorities but pure criminals. There were countless cases of extra-judicial killings around the country with wide condemnations. Or is it because cultists kill their fellow tribesmen and non-tribesmen that there was no special hue and cry or those being killed by them were not humans?So, action of some miscreants should not be construed as representing their faith. It is societal rebirth that is needed to stop poisoning the minds of the young ones. Those whose daily and weekly message is to sow the seed of hatred in the hearts of their followers should know they are the major reason for the unfortunate incident at Sokoto College.More so, the social irritants making reckless comments on the issue should note that such statements only expose their ignorance and extremism further. For the fact that Deuteronomy 32 verse 42 says “I will make my arrows drunk with blood, while my sword devours flesh: the blood of the slain and the captives, the heads of the enemy leaders"" or Joshua 6 verse 21 that “They devoted the city to the LORD and destroyed with the sword every living thing in it-men and women, young and old, cattle, sheep and donkeys” or Luke 19 verse 27 that “But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me” does not mean that everyone is in line with these verses even when it is glaring that majority are in support of 1 Peter 3 verse 11 that “They should shun evil and do good; seek peace and chase after it.” Similarly, the Qur’an 2 (Surah Al-Baqarah) verse 190 says “""Fight in the cause of Allah those who fight you, but do not transgress limits"". Also, Allah said in Qur’an 8 (Surah Al-Anfal) verse 61 that “But if the enemy inclines towards peace, do thou also incline towards peace and trust in Allah”.Similarly Qur’an 5 (Surah Al-Maidah) verse 32 says “..whosoever kill a human being for other than manslaughter or corruption in the earth, it shall be as if he had killed all mankind, and whose save the life of one, it shall be as if he had saved the life of all mankind….”Therefore, it is glaring here the extent of peaceful co-existence encouraged by the two main religions. In a nutshell, God forbid evils and in no way will any normal human being supports callous actions apart from those who have been perpetually known for stoking violence as a way of making money through duping international organizations in the name of seeking for relief materials.Specifically, the Nigerian Constitution guarantees freedom to life in Section 33 where it says “(1) Every person has a right to life, and no one shall be deprived intentionally of his life, save in execution of the sentence of a court in respect of a criminal offence of which he has been found guilty in Nigeria.(2) A person shall not be regarded as having been deprived of his life in contravention of this section, if he dies as a result of the use, to such extent and in such circumstances as are permitted by law, of such force as is reasonably necessary - (a) for the defence of any person from unlawful violence or for the defence of property: (b) in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a person lawfully detained; or (c) for the purpose of suppressing a riot, insurrection or mutiny”.In this case, the life of the gruesomely murdered student was terminated abruptly by misled ignoramuses and not in line with any known law. What most of the fanatics do not understand is that it is a major sin to let the soul of another person terminates through one.Besides, those who are regarded as one’s opponent at a particular time could be in one’s camp tomorrow and be the saving grace of their erstwhile foe. So, if those people have been ignorantly eliminated, who would be the ‘saviour’ when the time comes for the rescue mission?Therefore, there is need for caution in demonstrating passion for any belief or ideology. At least, the politicians many of whom some people have eliminated themselves or become foes while defending them have become allies while their supporters are avowed enemies for life.While it is appalling that some people have been perennially engaging in their provocative venture being the major global warmongers but blame their victims, the wise ones should be more diplomatic at responding to their evil plans.From Spain to Netherlands to France and other countries, the same people are culpable at instigating blasphemous messages. What further evidence does the world need to know the greatest blood suckers in human history?In the meantime, RIFA appreciate Sokoto State police prompt action at restoring orderliness and hereby charge the Kwara State Police Command playing sentiment with human lives over the brother gruesomely murdered in Ijagbo, Kwara State in February 2022 to emulate the Sokoto Police Command by fishing out the criminals who have been enjoying protection and conspiracy of Kwara Police Command since then.Such selective justice will continue to breed acrimony for many have seen Kwara Police leadership as not only partial but culpable in Ijagbo murder. Although the Kwara State Police Commissioner and the PPRO reached out to RIFA leadership, they have however failed to expose the criminals involved in the murder at Ijagbo as if the criminals were ghosts.RIFA urge all to avoid unnecessary provocative reactions to slight misunderstanding and desist from jungle justice while those at the helms of affairs should always be fair at dispensing justice and stop selective arrest and prosecution of offenders.Luqman SoliuPresident,Rights and Freedom Advocates (RIFA)Source: https://wiseloaded.com/sokoto-college-murder-indictment-on-social-anarchy-rifa/",Sokoto College Murder : Indictment On Social Anarchy - RIFA

He laughs over most of these things people say about him.  You don’t want to be President and everybody says that you are a saint. No! They talk about his health.

Nyema Worukwo As He Obeys Party Directive, Declares Support for Ezemonye Ezekiel.Good Day Ladies and Gentlemen.May I seize this opportunity to thank my beloved supporters and our leader the Rt. Hon. Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi the Honourable Minister of transportation for providing leadership and direction when one was needed. I reaffirm my unalloyed loyalty to the All Progressives Congress (APC) Rivers State and Nigeria in general.I feel encouraged seeing party members in Ikwerre/Emohua Federal Constituency and across the State devote their time to the affairs of the party and in championing the Advancement of our common glory.Undoubtedly, I have followed closely and made sacrifices towards the development and success of our great party in my LGA in particular and the State in general. During this period, I have observed the setbacks experienced by my constituency, which necessitated my aspiration to vie for the position of Member representing Ikwerre/Emohua Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives.The Green Chamber is not a place for fat cats with loads of vested interests. It is a sacred temple where our collective dreams for the development of our people and constituency are given impetus. My policy and bills direction would have rested on eight pillars: Agricultural Development, Education, Healthcare, Poverty Alleviation, Entrepreneurial Development, Sports and Entertainment, Social Security, Youth and Women Inclusion in governance.However, recall that our party, over the years, has suffered a lot of setbacks as a result of supremacy battles, betrayal, rancour, and acrimony. These should not be and as my love for the party is paramount and non-negotiable, my ambition will rather be the antidote to the bleak situation in our party than generate disunity.With these in mind, I call on my supporters to respect the decision of the leadership of the party on whoever flies the Party’s flag in next year’s election. Members must also endeavour to respect each other for the smooth running of the party. As a people of one political family that believe in the same ideology, we must ensure that all hands must be on deck to build a State of our dreams.Therefore, my dear people, after several consultations and strategic plans to pursue my ambition, respected leaders along the line prevailed on me to accept the decision of the leadership on the RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL and as such, the ball has fallen on the feet of my elder brother, Hon. Ezemonye Ezekiel Amadi, as the consensus candidate for Ikwerre/Emohua Federal Constituency.Hon. Ezemonye Ezekiel Amadi and I met in Abuja. He has offered me his hand of fellowship. We also had some fruitful deliberations on how to ensure the success of our great party in the forthcoming elections. Thus, on behalf of myself and my supporters, we are open and willing to work with him. As we do that, I will suggest that my eight-point policy and bills direction be given paramount concern as they are for the interest of our people.Dear family, friends, well wishers and supporters, my ambition was essentially informed by the dedication to ensuring that the people’s welfare remains paramount. With that in mind, I have accepted wholeheartedly to drop my ambition and to join hands with other party faithfuls to work assiduously for the success of our dear party in the 2023 elections.Long live APC!Long live Rivers State!!,Long live the Federal Republic of Nigeria!!!Nyema Worukwo","Hon.

585,"Mosques Destroyed, Shops Burgled As Mob Attacks Nsukka Muslim CommunitiesThe altercation is said to have started when a Muslim woman selling tomato took Keke Napep from a village market to her shop in the town and argument ensued between her and the driver over her transport fare.The disagreement is reported to have generated to destruction and burning of properties belonging to Muslims in the area by the host communities that later deteriorated to burning of two mosques in the town.Speaking to BBC Hausa on Monday, one of the leaders of northerners in the area, Muhammad Adam Yusuf said, “Most of us northerners are now in hiding in police custody, while many have already travelled to their states.“Most shops belonging to our people including mine have been burgled and our wares carted away. Many have been wounded though none is reported dead so far.“In fact, more than 90% of Hausas have emigrated, the few of us are now hiding in police custody,” Yusuf said.The leader of Nsukka Muslim community, Alhaji Sani Ugwuanyi also told BBC Hausa that, “The two mosques, one for daily congregational prayers and the other one which is the central mosque here have both been destroyed.“The entire structure of the first mosque has been completely destructed while the central mosque has been burnt down.“There is also another Islamiyyah and Primary School that was also destructed,” he lamented.When contacted, the state’s Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Daniel Ndukwe said the force was not aware of the attacks but promised to investigate it.Meanwhile, the Nigerian Islamic human rights group, Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), has condemned the attacks on Muslims in Igboland.MURIC in a statement issued on Monday by its Director, Professor Ishaq Akintola called for a halt to the burning of mosques in the South East and South South.The organization also appealed to the Inspector General of Police to protect Muslims as well as their corporate and individual properties in the region.The statement said, “Two mosques were set ablaze by the Igbo in Enugu on Saturday, 31st October, 2020.“The Islamic School, Afikpo, Ebonyi State has also received threats of impending invasion. It will be recalled that 11 (eleven) Muslims were killed during the #EndSARS protests in Port Harcourt and Orlu while the Orlu Central Mosque was completely destroyed barely two weeks ago.“Markets belonging to Muslims in the region were also attacked and properties worth millions of naira were destroyed, including whole trailers with the goods.MURIC also alleged that the only Islamic school in the whole Eastern Nigeria located in Afikpo, Ebonyi State, is under palpable and severe threat of attack.“The school management has received about three threat messages in the past one week alone. Attack on the school is imminent and the state government has not uttered a word.”The Muslim rights group also remind the governors of Eastern and South-South states as the chief security officers in their respective states of their responsibility to protect all citizens under them.Daily Trust reports that the Muslim community in the region who are mostly northerners alleged that more than 40 of them have been killed and property worth billions of naira have been lost including burning of over 30 trucks and 12 other vehicles in the aftermath of #EndSARS protest in various parts of South-South and South-Eastern Nigeria.https://dailytrust.com/2-mosques-destroyed-shops-burgled-as-in-mob-attacks-on-nsukka-muslim-communities","Muslims Attacked In Nsukka, Mosques Burnt By Mob In Enugu"

Scores of Hausa/Fulani were attacked and set ablaze in South Western yoruba states.At that time not even one Yoruba leader or governor came out to condemn the massacres of innocent northerners. Not even one!Now fast forward to today when some crazy hoodlums decided to take laws into their own hands by killing one Debora Yakubu in Sokoto for alleged blasphemy. Now the southerners are all up in verbal arms forgetting that they were as silent as dodo when the Igboho-inspired massacres of northerners in the South West of Nigeria took place in February 2021.At that time, they kept silent with some even justifying the massacres. Now that the shoe is on other other foot, all he'll is let loose.

589,"EXPOSED!!! Despite Court Order Directing Hon. Dagogo's Release, Rivers State Government Keeps Him In DetentionThe Rivers State government and police authorities have continued to keep the member representing Degema-Bonny Federal constituency and governorship aspirant, Hon. Farrah Dagogo in detention despite Court order which directed that he be released. Federal High Court sitting in Port Harcourt Rivers State presided over by Hon. Justice E.A Obile had on Monday 9th May, 2022 pursuant to an exparte motion ordered for his release by the Police, pending the hearing of the substantive suit,The conditions attached to the order was however fulfilled at about 11am on Thursday. Despite meeting the conditions however, he is still detained in an undisclosed hospital where he is currently receiving treatment. Our correspondent gathered that the Commissioner of Police in Rivers State, Mr Friday Eboka has frustrated all efforts to release Hon. Dagogo.He was accused of declining to append his signature in relevant documents presented to him by the court after a confirmation from court which took him six hours. Allegedly acting on the instruction of the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike there are indications that the police authorities may shop for fresh trumped up allegations against Dagogo to continue keeping him in detention.The governorship aspirant was few weeks ago arrested for allegedly attacking the screening centre of PDP National Assembly aspirants in Port Harcourt, an allegation he has since denied. He was subsequently detained and charged to court.Pundits believe that his arrest masterminded by Gov. Wike is in an effort to thwart the lawmaker's governorship aspirant and impose an anointed candidate.Ibrahim Lawal, SA Media and Publicity to Hon. Dagogo had in a release accused the police a deliberately delaying the release of his principal, noting that a poisonous substance had been administered on him which the police want to circulate in the body system of the legislator.He said, ""From a source, we have it that Efeturi Irikefe, the Camp Commandant to Governor Nyesom Wike, who abducted Hon. Doctor Farah Dagogo with the approval of  CP Friday Eboka on April 28th, laced Hon. Doctor Farah Dagogo with substances, suspected to be poisonous, which have contributed to his deteriorating health in the custody of the police. The source has further notified us that the delay in obeying the court order by the Police Commissioner, CP Eboka is to ensure the substances are fully circulated on all parts of the Federal Lawmaker's body system. In other words, Hon. Doctor Farah Dagogo could be a walking corpse upon gaining his freedom. ""Therefore, we wish to bring it to the notice of the general public, the court and the Inspector General in particular, that CP Friday Eboka, the Commissioner of Police in Rivers State has gone rogue and an accomplice to all acts hatched to harm Hon. Doctor Farah Dagogo. While we demand immediate investigation into his activities, it is instructive to note that the Police Commissioner has turned himself to law and does not obey court order but he is now a proud political appendage of the Governor of Rivers State whose political bidding he willingly executes.""https://tvafrica24.com/despite-court-order-directing-hon-dagogos-release-rivers-state-government-keeps-him-in-detention/","Despite Court Order Directing Hon.

Why?Because they had good conscience, they were convinced they were doing the right thing, a good man doesn't hide, a righteous man has nothing to fear, compare this with IPOB who always wear masks, always hiding behind the innocents and love to deny every crime even when their fingerprints are all over the place. This is a sign of bad conscience they are not truly convinced they are doing the right thing they have condemned themselves even before others condemned them...This is just a brief example of just how unequal criminals and murderers can be.""Tom Marvolo,Honorary Student of Hogwarts,Researcher and Explorer.","""Northern Terrorists Are More Civilized Than Eastern Terrorists"" - Tom Marvolo"
594,"TOSSED up, Nigeria’s spinning politics is a coin with three sides: head, tail and middle. All three sides came into play on Friday when a photograph taken at the South-West presidential aspirants’ meeting of the All Progressives Congress hit the internet with a twist in the tail.In the photograph, some of the South-West APC presidential aspirants flashed smiles on their faces but kept bile in their hearts. They held hands out to shake but swords lay hidden within their sleeves. If looks were daggers, many would have been stabbed into shreds.There was more peace in Ukraine than the peace in the Lagos House venue of the meeting at Marina. There was more love in Sambisa Forest, and more warmth on the ocean floor than the dubious affection displayed as Yoruba political maturity to deceive that all is well.All is not well in the APC well. The reported refusal of the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, to sit beside APC National Secretary, Otunba Iyiola Omisore, and Osun Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, was a testimony that the water in APC’s well is on the boil.Leading politicians at the fence-mending meeting were the chief convener, former interim National Chairman of the party, Chief Bisi Akande, and co-convener, a former Governor of Ogun State, Chief Segun Osoba.Also at the meeting were the so-called National Leader of the party, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu; his erstwhile godson, but today’s rallying point for some disgruntled party radicals, Professor Yemi Osinbajo; Omisore, Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Otunba Adeniyi Adebayo; former Governor Gbenga Daniel of Ogun State, former Governor-turned senator, Chief Ibikunle Amosun; Governor Oyetola, Ekiti State governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi; Ondo State Governor, Arakunrin Rotimi Akeredolu; Ogun State Governor, Chief Dapo Abiodun, and an ex-deputy governor, Oyo State, Chief Adeyemo Alake.An unknown evil genius sympathetic to Tinubu had put his creative mischief to use, twisting a religious tale into the innocuous APC picture, and posted it online, setting the stage for an online war. The evil genius had cropped out other stakeholders of the APC from the picture, leaving out only 13 cross-sectional leaders of the ruling national party. He then placed the APC picture above the timeless painting of the Last Supper involving Jesus Christ and his disciples, drawn by Leonardo da Vinci.When the picture of the 13 APC leaders appeared online alongside the 13-man painting of Jesus and his 12 disciples, it was captioned, “The Last Supper.” Subsequently, supporters of Tinubu and those of Osinbajo scrambled for the head and tail of the spinning political coin while some circumspect few made a grab for the middle.Osinbajo’s supporters, not prepared to tolerate the ‘betrayal’ tag being pinned on their aspirant, asked: “Who is Jesus in the picture?” Tinubu supporters retorted, “Judas knows himself.”Preferring the middle side of the coin, however, I thought the best caption to the APC picture was, “A Jesusless Last Supper,” because I didn’t see no Jesus at that supper, nor did I see one Judas. Remember, Judas was the treasurer of Jesus’ ministry. He got 30 shekels of silver. He was a rich man. Only rich people can afford to pay N100m for presidential form.Contrary to newspaper reports, the aim of the meeting wasn’t to pick a consensus candidate. The aim was to douse the political tension among the presidential sons of Oduduwa.Baba Akande, a staunch Tinubu supporter, strongly believes that the former Lagos governor will crush the former Lagos commissioner for justice and attorney general in a free and fair presidential primary. Akande feels the campaign of calumny between Tinubu and Osinbajo’s supporters will hurt the eventual APC candidate, hence the need to rein in the warring party supporters.Despite his obvious frailty, which he alluded to by saying the job of the president doesn’t require strength but brain, Tinubu appears to have wormed his way deeper into the hearts of party leaders across the country with his stipendiary brand of politics even as the catchphrase, “Judas the betrayer,” has caught on among party members.What does a Tinubu presidency portend for Nigeria? Danger. His prebendal variety of politics will asphyxiate the political space, put public money into private pockets, and make a few overfed cronies have a sense of entitlement to national treasury, singing jeun s’oke ko tun jeun s’apo.Tinubu’s Machiavellian politics has been sustained in Lagos by the embattled National Union of Road Transport Workers, a murderous organisation that has worked hand in glove with the ruling party in Lagos State since 1999. Nigeria doesn’t need such a man for president.If Tinubu’s godson and erstwhile state chairman of the National Union of Road Transport Workers in Lagos, Musiliu Akinsanya alias MC Oluomo, could be rewarded with the hurriedly created position of Chairman, Lagos Parks Management Committee, after being sacked by the national NURTW, lives on Lagos streets would be cheaper than dirt if Tinubu emerges as President.Osinbajo is a hypocrite. After serving under two terrible masters, Tinubu, and the clueless retired Major General Muhammadu Buhari, for four terms, Osinbajo hopes to come out sparkling clean from 16 years of political muddiness. Èyàn ò tan ara è bii Bàbá Fìyìn.Osinbajo is a sweet talker. Gold is the colour of the honey in his mouth. Gold is the colour of the political fire bellowing at the thatched House of APC. In King James Bible, Jesus says, “A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.” Therefore, how can the Osinbajo tree whose roots have drawn water from two poisoned brooks for 16 years bring forth good fruit?In Daniel 4:14, there is an instruction on what to do to bad trees, “Cut down the tree and chop off its branches; strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the beasts flee from under it, and the birds from its branches.”Tinubu, Osinbajo’s former boss, never pretends to be a saint. He neither wears a turban nor clutches a rosary. His son, Seyi; daughter and Iyaloja General of Nigeria, Folashade Tinubu-Ojo, and other family members unashamedly clutch the fattest pies in the land while hunger stalks the land. But what is Fiyin, the son of Osinbajo, doing with a big bag of dollars on the bus taking guests to the wedding of Buhari’s son, Yusuf? And you think Osinbajo hasn’t learnt anything from Tinubu, and Buhari whose daughter, Hanan, turned presidential planes into playthings. Someone asked me a question about which Man of God was involved in multi-billion naira road contracts in Osun during the Aregbesola years. I answered, “I no know book o, ishh.”Another person also asked me, “Which servant of the Most High is currently doling out dollars and naira to traditional rulers, market men and women?” I replied, “If Buhari could reward the indicted, suspended and disgraced Ibrahim Magu with AIG promotion, why arrest IPOB members for calling Nigeria a zoo?”If you think certificates or professorship confer wisdom or integrity, remember Goodluck Jonathan and receive sense. By the way, there’s little difference between the way Nigerian vice chancellors and MC Oluomo think. Wives of Nigerian university vice chancellors have formed an association, it’s called Committee of Vice Chancellors of Nigerian Universities Spouses, and it’s solidly supported by Committee of Vice Chancellors of Nigerian Universities.At a time when the strike in Nigerian public universities has entered its third month, the spouses of VCs are embarking on a N1.5m per person trip to Turkey to learn how to help their VC husbands build capacity. Would the husbands of female VCs also partake in this madness?Yesterday, MC Oluomo was state chairman, NURTW. Today, he’s Chairman, Lagos Parks Management, tomorrow, he will be vice chancellor and king.

He went on to unveil a 5-point agenda that will drive his policy as Governor in order to meet the yearnings of the people.He promised to give the welfare of workers and pensioners the attention it deserves, noting that as Governor he will ensure ""First line charge for workers' welfare, salaries, gratuities, and pensions."" Others on the list are: ""Boosting State economy by business partnering and support for business class; Osun money serving Osun people through homegrown infrastructure policy; People-focussed social policy through skill-based education, affordable health care, state security, and social security support; and Agro-based Industrialisation for wealth and job creation for youths and women.""Senator Adeleke assured Osun people that he will work on putting the decaying infrastructures back in shape, saying unlike what is happening under the APC government, his main interest will be Osun people and not lining the pockets of friends and cronies.Welcoming the mammoth crowd at the rally, the Director General of the Adeleke Campaign Organization, Hon Sunday Bisi urged the people of the state to eschew violence in the face of APC provocations but should do everything to protect their votes for the PDP in the July 16 governorship election.According to the DG, APC are aware their time is up in the state, hence, their resort to all manners of antics, including habitual sweeping of PDP campaign venues as well as dishing out 'end time' promises. Also speaking at the rally, a prominent leader of the party in the state, Akogun Lere Oyewumi commended the people of Osogbo and indeed Osun Central for their massive show of support for the PDP and the candidate, Senator Ademola Jackson Nurudeen Adeleke. He admonished electorate in the senatorial district not to cave in to any form of intimidation in the forthcoming election, saying, nothing should dissuade them from replicating their unprecedented support at the poll.Signed:Oladele Bamiji, HOB,Secretary, Media and Publicity Committee,Senator Ademola Adeleke Campaign Organisation","Osun 2022: Senator Adeleke Unveils 5-Point Agenda, Vows To Unseat Oyetola"

I have removed the expletives she used: ""holy ghost fire, nothing will happen to us. Must you send the things you send, this group was not created to send all this rubbish, it was created to send matters of test, assignments etc. The prophet of Allah  @%/#*&* "" (the last phrase she uttered were extremely offensive hence i used symbols) .Like I said the essence is to analyse what she said. One wonders, was she deliberately trying to start a religious crisis thinking it wouldn't go beyond the usual social media banter against Muslims?I ask this because   for some one trying to stop religious posts in a chat group do you start by saying ""Holy ghost fire""? This is self contradiction. Secondly, after making your point on not posting religious materials in the chat, why on earth did she had to insult the prophet (peace be upon him)It is a fact that Muslims revere the Prophets of Allah more than anything in this world, and the prophet of Islam occupies a special place in their heart.It is also a fact that although ignorant people have over time and in different places used bad words against the prophet (PBUH), no Muslim worth the name dear mention great prophets like Moses, Ezekiel  etc without saying ""peace be upon them or ""Alaihim Salaam"" or AS, not to think of using bad speech against themSo it is important to state that I condemn the act of taking laws into one's hand, but also condemn any form of instigation and inciting speech against anyone, Muslims and non Muslims alike",Critical Analysis Of The Comment That Got Deborah Killed.

618,"DEPARTING MINISTERS TO BE REPLACED WITHOUT DELAYPresident Muhammadu Buhari on Friday in Abuja bade farewell to outgoing members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC), affirming that a significant number of them have been sufficiently equipped to aspire to higher elective offices, including the Office of the President.Speaking at a valedictory session for appointees leaving the cabinet to pursue political ambitions, the President said:''I have no doubt that if the next President emerges from among former members of this cabinet, like any other aspirant, ample competence and outstanding service delivery would be on display. This will be part of our legacies to Nigerians.''The President, who commended the departing public officers for serving the nation sacrificially, ''with dignity and honour'', had at the last FEC meeting on Wednesday, May 11, 2022 directed that all Ministers and other political appointees who aspire to contest for elective offices in the 2023 General Elections should resign their current appointments.''I note that some have complied while others are in the process of doing so. ''I would like to use this opportunity to commend your decision and courage to contest for elective offices and your compliance with my directive.''I also wish to thank you for your invaluable services to this nation through your contributions as Cabinet members.''I wish you success in the upcoming elections and in your future endeavours,'' he said.President Buhari told the ministers that looking back as the head of the team over the years, he had fond memories of incisive and robust discussions during cabinet meetings, rendering of performance reports during special sessions and presidential retreats.''In 2015, citizens of this country overwhelmingly voted for me to become the President of this nation on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC).''Selecting members of the Cabinet went through a careful process so that the best and most competent could emerge. The performance of that class of 2015 proved me right.''In 2019, Nigerians similarly re-elected me as President. Again the selection went through another meticulous process.''That re-election was significant because it served as a referendum on our performance during the first term and it inspired me to bring back some of the members of the first cabinet either to their old Ministries or re-assigned to other sectors.''New Members were also brought on board to inject fresh energies, skills and ideas to enhance the execution of government’s programs and policies.''With these and much more, I am happy to note that a significant number of cabinet members have become sufficiently equipped to aspire to higher elective offices, including the Office of the President. This shows the impact of the experience gathered while serving as members of the Federal Executive Council,'' he said.The President acknowledged that prior to some of them joining his cabinet; they had made their marks in other areas as governors, legislators, entrepreneurs and core professionals.He added that the experience and expertise they brought on board have significantly resulted in enormous development in various sectors and the accomplishment of government programmes.''These include infrastructure, agriculture, health systems, financial management, administration of justice, building social safety net systems,'' he said.Noting that the departure of some cabinet members has undoubtedly created a vacuum that should be filled, the President said appointments would be made without delay so that the business of governance will not suffer.President Buhari urged the remaining members of the cabinet to show more diligence, resilience and commitment to serve Nigerians better, saying ‘‘the journey to the finish line is still very far ’’. ''Like always, there will be challenges to address, programmes to deliver and policies to implement.''You must therefore brace up for more work and target increased accomplishments.''The determination to leave important legacies for Nigerians should never be compromised,'' the President told members of his cabinet.The following outgoing members of FEC were present at the valedictory session: ministers of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi; Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio; Science, Technology and Innovation, Ogbonnaya Onu, State for Petroleum, Timipre Sylva; Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige.Others are the Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), Minister of State, Mines and Steel Development, Uche Ogah, the Minister of Women Affairs, Pauline Tallen and the Minister of State for Niger Delta Affairs, Chief Tayo Alasoadura.The Minister of State (Education), Emeka Nwajiuba, who had earlier tendered his resignation, was not present at the valedictory session.Speaking on behalf of the outgoing ministers, Akpabio thanked the President for giving them the opportunity to serve and contribute their quota to nation building.He described working with the President as a ‘‘fantastic and knowledgeable experience,’’ adding that as they step aside they will continue to be great disciples of Buhari.''As we step aside from FEC, I want you to know that you have disciples in us. I want you to know that it is time for us to propagate Buharism.''I want you to know that we are going to be working closely with the Minister of Information and Culture to take your message of transformation, love, patience, administrative sagacity to Nigerians, '' he said.The Niger Delta Minister told the President that from his interactions with colleagues leaving the cabinet was like the story of the Spanish play of ‘‘sadness and joy.’’''Sadness in the sense that we are going to miss the continuous daily and weekly interaction with a Father and learning from him; joy because we now have an opportunity to go to the wider audience in Nigeria to speak more of your achievements for this country. ''Lauding the President’s deep patriotism, Akpabio said he is the ''best president Nigeria could ever have had at a time of difficult circumstances.''He prayed God Almighty to grant the President a successful tenure and protect his family, adding:''May one of us succeed you in order to continue the good legacies you have laid on ground.

On the importance of the legislations, the President said:""The signing of these Bills into law today not only strengthens the Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework in the Country, but addresses the deficiencies identified in Nigeria’s 2nd round of Mutual Evaluation as assessed by Inter-Governmental Action Group Against Money Laundering in West Africa on compliance with the Financial Action Task Force global standards.""Accordingly, the repeal of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2011 as amended and enactment of Money Laundering (Prevention and Prohibition) Act, 2022 provides comprehensive legal and Institutional Framework for the prevention and prohibition of money laundering in Nigeria and confers on the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, the legal status of the Special Control Unit Against Money Laundering.""The repeal of the Terrorism (Prevention) Act, 2011 as amended in 2013, and enactment of the Terrorism Prevention and Prohibition) Act, 2022 provides for the effective implementation of international instruments on the prevention and combating of terrorism and suppression of the financing of terrorism.""The enactment of the Proceeds of Crime (recovery and Management) Act, 2022 makes comprehensive provisions for the seizure, confiscation, forfeiture and management of properties derived from unlawful activity. ""President Buhari told the ceremony attended by the Senate President and other Senators, the Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, Heads of anti-corruption agencies, including ICPC and EFCC, that the executive arm of government ""carefully avoided creating another asset recovery and management agency with its cost implications in deference to government’s sensitivity to the rising cost of governance.""He explained that the new law mandates the creation of dedicated accounts for the proceeds of crime and other confiscated assets in order to enhance the accountability of the process:""I have therefore taken time to note the emphasis placed on collaboration, synergy and unification of strategies and measures to combat the scourge of Money Laundering and terrorism financing and proliferation financing in the Act. ""The primary objectives of these measures are to ensure effective, unified and comprehensive legal, regulatory and institutional framework for the implementation of the Acts. ""This is profound and calls for coordinated responses to the challenges posed by the menace.  I therefore charge all relevant agencies to ensure effective implementation of these new laws. ""The robust frameworks diligently enshrined in the Acts can only serve useful purposes when every bit of them is enforced.""Stressing that the fight against corruption requires an “All of Government, All of Nation approach’’, the President affirmed that every Nigerian had a role to play to rid the country of corrupt practices.He commended the members of the National Action Task Force comprising several Ministries, Departments and Agencies of Government, noting that the bills are a clear demonstration of government functioning at its best with coordination, collaboration, and execution all towards a common goal.

624,"The Social Democratic Party (SDP) says it will welcome APC national leader Bola Tinubu, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and other aspirants willing to contest elective positions in 2023 on the party’s platform.SDP acting national chairman Supo Shonibare, who stated this at a news conference in Abuja on Thursday, however, said aggrieved aspirants from other parties must not come to the party with “baggage.”Mr Shonibare said while those who felt cheated in other political parties could come and join the SDP to pursue their political ambitions in 2023, they should be ready to submit themselves to stringent conditions, including integrity tests.He also clarified that Mr Tinubu was not a registered member of the SDP.“On the issue of Asiwaju Tinubu, the last time I checked, he is not a member of the SDP. I checked on the list because the membership list of our party as INEC has required, has already been submitted by our state chapters to us in Abuja,” said the SDP leader. “His name is not among those who are members of our party in Lagos State. That’s all I can say, he’s not a member of SDP.”He, however, said the APC national leader or any other aspirant from other registered political parties interested to join the party was welcome.“Yes, we welcome anyone felt cheated by another political party, but must be consistent with integrity. If he (Tinubu) comes, it won’t be automatic. What we would emphasise is consistency with integrity within the public officer,” explained Mr Shonibare. “Also anyone who is controversial, rated low or with baggage, who doesn’t have integrity will not be allowed. SDP leadership does not want the party to be an opportunistic vehicle.”Mr Shonibare also maintained that the party would only give consideration to individuals cheated by his party but not in controversial circumstances.“In instances where we’ve seen great injustices to an individual, who we feel is not coming to us with baggage, yes that individual will be welcome to SDP,” he noted. “But we won’t welcome anyone who we feel has a pending court case. We won’t welcome anyone that has been convicted, even if the person is actually now appealing that conviction.”He said the SDP would pay attention to defectors with integrity and honour.On the party leadership crisis, Mr Shonibare maintained that INEC lacked the powers to determine the authentic leadership of SDP.“INEC is not the court of law, so it cannot determine which fact is the rightful leadership of the party. It is the constitution of the party, the rules of the party and the determination of the court that will determine who is the legitimate leadership of the party. It is that process that INEC will oblige to accept,” he said. “We shall resist the machinations of the burgeoning usurpers.” https://gazettengr.com/2023-tinubu-osinbajo-can-join-us-if-cheated-in-apc-sdp/",2023: Tinubu Will Join Us When He Loses In APC - SDP

631,"The United States’ Missions in parts of Africa are replete with under hand deals. It is unbelievably embarrassing. Aside the fact that the missions have abandoned their core objectives of advancing peace and other consular services, they have become centers of meddlesomeness and interferers in internal governance systems of host countries. These adversarial actions have been deemed despicable. Over the decades, America has engaged in activities aimed at undermining administrations across the Continent. The US Department of State is either doling out bad predictions and estimates about African countries or issuing recurrent but repulsive movement and travel alerts for their nationals suggesting the region is constantly unsafe. While the advisories are oftentimes exaggerated, the scare actions are done solely to justify and acquire more funding from their home government for self-serving of the diplomatsNotably, the US Mission in Nigeria has continued to exploit insecurity to justify its ostentatious proposals to her country. While the US and its agents exploit security concerns and socio-economic challenges bedeviling the country, it has failed to curb its home-based security challenges that are threatening the safety of its citizens. It is common knowledge that gun violence, mass shootings, rising drug-related crimes, arson, homicide, rape, suicide, aggravated assault, robbery and cybercrime are more prevalent in the United States than in Nigeria. White supremacist activities are even more active. Surprisingly, American government has not only turned a blind eye to these security concerns over the years, but has also continued to downplay or censor the gravity of crimes in their homeland. It is estimated that mass shootings is responsible for the death of over 39,000 people each year, implying that over 360 people get shot every day in the country. While the United States ranks higher than the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia in terms of mass shootings, another study found that nearly one-third of the world's public mass shootings (90 of 292 between 1966 and 2012) occurred in the United States.To the US and its missions in Nigeria, the daily gun violence and attacks in their country are excusable. However, it beats ones imagination, that the pockets of restiveness in Nigeria are more important to them than their frequent incidences of violence. If these attacks by armed citizens in US were to happen in Nigeria, the American government and its agents would have long premised on the situation to undermine its leadership. While the US has persistently highlighted issues surrounding Nigeria’s socio-cultural complications, it has apparently ignored its many related socio-cultural challenges and unanswered relevant questions on gun control and racism. White supremacy crises have continued to manifest through consistent violent attacks, racial discrimination, unfair immigration policies, and the skewed media role against the black race. More worrisome is the growing number of atrocities been committed in the US by white supremacist groups, with black men as principal victims. Over the decades, white supremacist ideology was used to rationalize the genocide of Native Americans and the enslavement of blacks and their descendants from the Colonial period to the 19th century. This practice has remained within American government institutions. Furthermore, it is quite amazing how the US covertly supported dissidents that staged the ENDSARS protests across Nigeria. The subversive elements were allowed to use twitter and other similar platforms to organize, communicate and execute attacks against citizens, critical infrastructure and institutions in the country. Jack, the ex CEO of Twitter, in consolidating the interest of American government to threaten public order and stability in Nigeria, out-rightly refused to suspend accounts of the ENDSARS organizers. Meanwhile, the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau after he was hit by truckers protests in the country, described their action as “unacceptable”. Twitter, still under the control of Jack, wasted no time in suspending the twitter accounts of the protesting truckers, what double standards! The 2021 attack and insurrection at Capitol Hill has indeed exposed the Achilles’ heel of the American government and its systems.There is definitely no gainsaying the fact that America is as corrupt as the Nigerian governments they castigate and term corrupt. It is on record that the United States' resistance to corruption has declined in recent years. It has dropped from its rank of 18th in 2016, to 27th out of 180 countries on the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index of 2021. More so, in the recently released annual Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), the United States fell to a low of 67 out of a maximum possible score of 100, down from a high of 76 in 2015. This simply means the lower the score, the worse the corruption. The many ways of how corruption thrives in the US include the influence of wealthy individuals over government; “pay to play” politics and the revolving doors between elected government office, for-profit companies, and professional associations; and the abuse of the US financial system by corrupt foreign kleptocrats and local elites. It is, however, laudable that Nigerian government and the populace are beginning to wake up from their slumber and opposing the offensive attitude of US Government and their counterparts. In most cases, they are more corrupt and churning out projections and security alerts to their nationals, only to secure more allocations to fund their extravagant lifestyles. These so called US diplomats love to live large. They use the constant security scare to deceive their home government to get more money for ostensive living in the host country, acquire treated (armoured) cars; build palatial residences in the US and frolic with women of sorts.  Nigeria and other African governments must sustain this ""wokeness"" and resist the continuous attempt to undermine their sovereignty at the expense of crooked personalities and self-centered interests.Written by Richard Babatunde, a Lagos Based International Relations Analyst.",Us’ Double Standards In Her Nigerian Mission

638,"By Oluwafemi Popoola and Mayowa OlaniyanIt appears the growing support base and the stratosphere of the popularity of Nigeria’s Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, is a nightmare waiting to happen in the camp of his fiercest rivals in the APC politics ahead of the party’s primary election, an investigation has revealed.According to findings, to bring a twist into the free burning rivalry with VP Osinbajo by another top contender in the party, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, there are plans by two governors close to the former Lagos State governor within the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), to whittle down Osinbajo’s growing popularity among Nigerians, especially in the North, being the preferred choice of delegates and political stakeholders in the region.These men, who have grown to form a ‘cabal,’ hiding in the shadows to throw gravel are said to be perturbed and unsettled by the media buzz currently enjoyed by the VP, hence, in a desperate move to remain in the chess game, these powerful persons are said to be working assiduously to scuttle the party’s zoning arrangement with just some days to the party’s primary election.The frantic race of who wins the presidential ticket of the ruling APC, recently, has apparently taken a new twist with the sudden influx of aspirants in the presidential race, causing confusion and anxiety within the party and the entire country with full-blown chaos of narratives being thrown around.Although the APC is set to hold its primary elections on May 30 and 31, 2022, after the party fixed the cost of the presidential nomination and expression of interest forms at N100 million, developments have led to heightened tensions and uncertainties over who eventually clinches the party presidential ticket.Though, the aspiration of the Vice President Osinbajo appears to be the cynosure of all eyes in the political space, with the flow of endorsement for his ambition said to be unprecedented for a perceived political neophyte as the VP is viewed in some sections of his party, particularly the bloc where he emerged from, yet, the quest for new leadership in 2023 is turning out a big deal in the political arena.As reliably gathered, the rising profile of the Vice President and his quest to be the nation’s number one man is already sending jitters to the camp of his rivals within the party, especially, those who are threatened and intimidated by the development. Laying credence to this is the sudden foray into the contest of some unlikely names and personalities who have suddenly thrown their hat into the ring to contest the 2023 presidency.Even though the N100 million price tag placed on the nomination form seems to be on the high side, this has not deterred these politicians from joining the race, some of whom the public has tagged “pretenders.”At the last count, 26 aspirants have purchased the nomination forms of the APC, and of the 26, only three have been enjoying media mentions and are seen as leading contenders for the party’s nomination.They are Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, former Governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and current Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, as the rest have suddenly kept mute since the razzmatazz of their declaration, while not a single word has been heard from their camps.The actions of the other aspirants have laid suspicion on their motive of purchasing their nomination forms in the first place, while some political watchers claimed the main reason for their actions is to negotiate their way into the new government that will be formed on May 29, 2023, contending that, they are only quietly watching where the pendulum swings.Meanwhile, as it has been publicly appraised, VP Osinbajo, who hails from Ikenne Ogun State, in South-West Nigeria, analysts have said, has proven to be a galvanizing figure not only in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) but across all the six geo-political zones in Nigeria, for his candidature in the past couple of weeks has caused a frenzy in the media space.The entry of the VP since he declared his intention to run for the presidency is also said to be causing unrest and panic in the party as it appears the ruling APC is set to pick its presidential candidate from the South West.As earlier argued in public spaces, the region, it was said, remains the best bet for the ruling APC to pick its candidate, as apart from the fact that it held the ace for the party in the 2015 and 2019 elections, it remains the only region from the South that is capable enough to form a solid alliance with the North to produce Nigeria’s next president.However, major contenders opposed to Osinbajo’s emergence in the South-West, who populated the APC ‘cabal’ are allegedly not favoured by the President, whose body language seems to favour his deputy succeeding him, though the President had stated he won’t reveal his preferred candidate for fear of being eliminated.These powerful elements had hoped to ward off challenges from Osinbajo and others to get the APC presidential ticket through direct primaries but it appears the APC party is planning on a consensus candidate for the position of the President.But to help push through their ambitions, as gathered, these men have created sorts of strategies to make the dream a reality, hence, they had to devise different approaches to scuttle decisions in their favour.An investigation has revealed that part of the strategy is to cause a paradigm shift in the media narratives and strip the spotlight from the VP, who has begun nationwide consultations to meet with party delegates and critical stakeholders in the party, which it was said explains the hasty population of the number of the presidential aspirants purposely created to confuse many Nigerians and heat the polity.According to sources who are in the know of this development and the internal politicking in the ruling party, the so-called “pretenders” may not be embarking on this futile journey on their own as their moves are being sponsored by influential elements within the party, and among those big names said to be cajoled into the party to fulfil their agenda included former President, Goodluck Jonathan, the President of African Development Bank (AfDB), Akinwumi Adesina, the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan and others.While Akinwumi Adesina has been distancing himself from the groups who purchased the APC nomination forms for him, the ex-President, Goodluck Jonathan, has decided to run for president in 2023, barely 48 hours after he had earlier disowned a nomination form procured for him by a northern group.There are even several media reports that the former President has also joined the APC formally, having registered at his Otuoke Ward in Bayelsa.Also, the same way the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, who was against the party zoning arrangement declared his presidential ambition recently and former Governor of Edo State Adams Oshiomole, following suit is said to be suspicious.Both Senator Ahmed Lawan and Comrade Adams Oshiomole are known to be close allies to Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, who is a leading contender for the APC Presidential ticket, and It is public knowledge of how the former governor of Lagos supported the current Senate President to achieve his ambition of leading the Senate after a failed attempt in 2015.Oshiomole on the other hand remains a close ally of Tinubu, whom he rode on his back to become the National Chairman of the APC. Many political watchers, till now, still believe the unceremonious ouster of Comrade Oshiomole was part of a strategy to clip the wings of the godfather of Lagos politics.Now, with their sudden appearance in the APC presidential race, sources who analysed the situation said “they are in for a game” to favour the political interest of their one-time benefactor.”https://thedailyleaks.com/2023-presidency-2-govs-afraid-of-osinbajos-headway-in-north-cajole-jonathan-adesina-lawan-to-run/","2 Govs Afraid Of Osinbajo’s Headway In North Cajole Jonathan, Adesina To Run"

He said Governor Yahaya who received the campaign team of the Ekiti State Governor led by a former Deputy National Chairman of the APC, explained that with Governor Fayemi’s deep knowledge as Chairman of the Nigerian Governors’ Forum, “he is undeniably the best among the presidential aspirants who have been here and we will back you to the end,”Continuing, Governor Yahaya said; “Fayemi has widely acknowledged experience, energy capacity, and deep knowledge.

I have been encouraged by your consensus building capabilities and I personally encouraged you to step out for the big job and I am happy that you have taken up the challenge”.Responding, the Ekiti governor thanked his Gombe counterpart and the delegates for the reception, promising not to take the endorsement and the love shown him for granted.Fayemi hinged the core programme of his government if elected on Security, Economy, Energy and Job Creation. The presidential aspirant said: “Any government who can successfully tackle these would have succeeded in bringing happiness to our country, discourage the urge to secede and address our perennial problem of youth restiveness. I believe I have the education, the energy, the capacity and the knowledge to tackle these myriad of problems” the governor added.Noting that he may not be the richest among the aspirants, Fayemi said “history has shown us that the richest or children of the richest have never ruled Nigeria. “Tafawa Balewa was a teacher, Shagari a headmaster, Obasanjo had no money when he left prison, Umaru Yar’Adua was a university teacher, Jonathan had no shoes and of course we know the background of our current president. What Nigeria needs now are education, capacity, energy, experience which I have in abundance.“Nigeria needs a president who will make the Onitsha man feel comfortable in Sokoto and the Kano man to feel at home in Ibadan or Awka. I feel this best describes me and I promise not to let you down,” he pledgedhttps://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/05/2023-gombe-governor-yahaya-endorses-fayemis-presidential-ambition/","Gombe Governor, Yahaya Hugs Fayemi, Endorses His Presidential Ambition (Pix)"

649,"Robert Clarke, senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN), says the Nigerian constitution allows President Muhammadu Buhari to extend his tenure in order to tackle the country’s security challenges.Clarke spoke when he featured on Arise Television’s morning show on Monday.Speaking on the future of Nigeria and if the country is on the right track, Clarke said since 1999, Nigeria has had the worst form of government.He said with the myriad of security challenges, Nigeria may not have a good election year.He said if insecurity makes it impossible for the 2023 elections to take place, the constitution provides that the president can extend his tenure by six months, in the first instance, to fix things.He, however, said with the way things are, he does not think six months is enough to win the war against insecurity.He said the alternative is for Buhari to continue as president until the country becomes stable.“I am 84 years old, and I can assure you I’ve had the best time in my life, both in my legal practice, in my social life, in every aspect of life, but I can assure you, that those days are gone by. Since 1999, I have not been a happy man, the way and manner Nigeria has been moved,” Clarke said.“For instance, look at our first president, Obasanjo with due respect. What was the first negative act he did? ‘I want a third term’. Can you imagine? But he says, ‘oh, it’s not me who wants it, is my friend who is asking me to go for a third term’. That is how we started the 1999 constitution by looking for loopholes to breach the constitution.“The only consolation is that the constitution provides that the president can stay longer than eight years. I’ve always said it. It is in the constitution.“If the situation in which we are in now continues, and it is impossible to hold the 2023 election, the constitution says if a situation persists, the president will tell INEC in view of all insurgencies, in view of kidnappings, in view of Boko Haram, I don’t think in these different areas of Nigeria, we can have a good election.“I am 84 years old, and I can assure you I’ve had the best time in my life, both in my legal practice, in my social life, in every aspect of life, but I can assure you, that those days are gone by.

650,"Flashback: Speech presented by Major Gideon Orkar on April 22, 1990Fellow Nigerian Citizens, on behalf of the patriotic and well-meaning peoples of the Middle Belt and the southern parts of this country, I , Major Gideon Orkar, wish to happily inform you of the successful ousting of the dictatorial, corrupt, drug baronish, evil man, deceitful, homosexually-c­­entered, prodigalistic, un-patriotic administration of General Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida.We have equally commenced their trials for unabated corruption, mismanagement of national economy, the murders of Dele Giwa, Major-General Mamman Vasta, with other officers as there was no attempted coup but mere intentions that were yet to materialise and other human rights violations.The National Guard already in its formative stage is disbanded with immediate effect. Decrees Number 2 and 46 are hereby abrogated. We wish to emphasize that this is not just another coup but a well-conceived,­­ planned and executed revolution for the marginalized, oppressed and enslaved peoples of the Middle Belt and the south with a view to freeing ourselves and children yet unborn from eternal slavery and colonisation by a clique of this country.Our history is replete with numerous and uncontrollable instances of callous and insensitive dominatory repressive intrigues by those who think it is their birthright to dominate till eternity the political and economic privileges of this great country to the exclusion of the people of the Middle Belt and the south.They have almost succeeded in subjugating the Middle Belt and making them voiceless and now extending same to the south.It is our unflinching belief that this quest for domination, oppression and marginalisation­­ is against the wish of God and therefore, must be resisted with the vehemence.Anything that has a beginning must have an end. It will also suffice here to state that all Nigerians without skeleton in their cupboards need not to be afraid of this change. However, those with skeleton in their cupboards have all reasons to fear, because the time of reckoning has come.For the avoidance of doubt, we wish to state the three primary reasons why we have decided to oust the satanic Babangida administration.­­The reasons are as follows:(1) To stop Babangida’s desire to cunningly install himself as Nigeria’s life president at all costs and by so doing, slowpoke the progress of this country for life. In order to be able to achieve this undesirable goals of his, he has evidently started destroying those groups and sections he perceived as being able to question his desires.Examples of groups already neutralized, pitched against one another or completely destroyed are:(a) The Sokoto caliphate by installing an unwanted Sultan to cause division within the hitherto strong Sokoto caliphate.(b) The destruction of the peoples of Plateau State, especially the Lantang people, as a balancing force in the body politics of this country.(c) The buying of the press by generous monetary favors and the usage of State Security Service, SSS, as a tool of terror.(d) The intent to cow the students by the promulgation of the draconian Decree Number 47.(e) The cowing of the university teaching and non-teaching staff by an intended massive purge, using the 150 million dollar loan as the necessitating factor.(f) Deliberately withholding funds to the armed forces to make them ineffective and also crowning his diabolical scheme through the intended retrenchment of more than half of the members of the armed forces.Other pointers that give credence to his desire to become a life president against the wishes of the people are:(1) His appointment of himself as a minister of defence, his putting under his direct control the SSS, his deliberate manipulation of the transition programme, his introduction of inconceivable, unrealistic and impossible political options, his recent fraternization with other African leaders that have installed themselves as life presidents and his dogged determination to create a secret force called the national guard, independent of the armed forces and the police which will be answerable to himself alone, both operationally and administrativel­­y.It is our strong view that this kind of dictatorial desire of Babangida is unacceptable to Nigerians of the 1990s, and, therefore, must be resisted by all.Another major reason for the change is the need to stop intrigues, domination and internal colonization of the Nigerian state by the so-called chosen few. This, in our view, has been and is still responsible for 90 percent of the problems of Nigerians.This indeed has been the major clog in our wheel of progress.This clique has an unabated penchant for domination and unrivalled fostering of mediocrity and outright detest for accountability,­­ all put together have been our undoing as a nation.This will ever remain our threat if not checked immediately. It is strongly believed that without the intrigues perpetrated by this clique and misrule, Nigeria will have in all ways achieved developmental virtues comparable to those in Korea, Taiwan, Brazil, India, and even Japan.Evidence, therefore, this cancerous dominance has as a factor constituted by a major and unpardonable clog in the wheel of progress of the Nigerian state. It is suffice to mention a few distasteful intrigues engineered by this group of Nigerians in recent past. These are:(1) The shabby and dishonorable treatment meted on the longest serving Nigerian general in the person of General Domkat Bali, who in actual fact had given credibility to the Babangida administration.(2) The wholesale hijacking of Babangida’s administration by the all-powerful clique.(3) The disgraceful and inexplicable removal of Commodore Ebitu Ukiwe, Professor Tam David-West, Mr. Aret Adams and so on from office.(4) The now-pervasive and on-going retrenchment of Middle Belt and southerners from public offices and their instant replacement by the favoured class and their stooges.(5) The deliberate disruption of the educational culture and retarding its place to suit the favoured class to the detriment of other educational minded parts of this country.(6) The deliberate impoverishment of the peoples from the Middle Belt and the south, making them working ghosts and feeding on the formulae of 0-1-1- or 0-0-0 while the aristocratic class and their stooges are living in absolute affluence on a daily basis without working for it.(7) Other countless examples of the exploitative, oppressive, dirty games of intrigues of its class, where people and stooges that can best be described by the fact that even though they contribute very little economically to the well-being of Nigeria, they have over the years served and presided over the supposedly national wealth derived in the main from the Middle Belt and the southern part of this country, while the people from these parts of the country have been completely deprived from benefiting from the resources given to them by God.The third reason for the change is the need to lay a strong egalitarian foundation for the real democratic take off of the Nigerian state or states as they circumstances may dictate.In the light of all the above and in recognition of the negativeness of the aforementioned aristocratic factor, the overall progress of the Nigerian state a temporary decision to excise the following states namely, Sokoto, Borno, Katsina, Kano and Bauchi states from the Federal Republic of Nigeria comes into effect immediately until the following conditions are met.The conditions to be met to necessitate the re-absorption of the aforementioned states are as following:(a) To install the rightful heir to the Sultanate, Alhaji Maccido, who is the people’s choice.(b) To send a delegation led by the real and recognized Sultan Alhaji Maccido to the federal government to vouch that the feudalistic and aristocratic quest for domination and operation will be a thing of the past and will never be practiced in any part of the Nigeria state.By the same token, all citizens of the five states already mentioned are temporarily suspended from all public and private offices in Middle Belt and southern parts of this country until the mentioned conditions above are met.They are also required to move back to their various states within one week from today. They will, however, be allowed to return and joint the Federal Republic of Nigeria when the stipulated conditions are met.In the same vein, all citizens of the Middle Belt and the south are required to come back to their various states pending when the so-called all-in-all Nigerians meet the conditions that will ensure a united Nigeria. A word is enough for the wise.This exercise will not be complete without purging corrupt public officials and recovering their ill-gotten wealth, since the days of the oil boom till date. Even in these hard times, when Nigerians are dying from hunger, trekking many miles to work for lack of transportation,­­ a few other Nigerians with complete impunity are living in unbelievable affluence both inside and outside the country.We are extremely determined to recover all ill-gotten wealth back to the public treasury for the use of the masses of our people. You are all advised to remain calm as there is no cause for alarm. We are fully in control of the situation as directed by God. All airports, seaports and borders are closed forthwith.The former Armed Forces Ruling Council is now disbanded and replaced with National Ruling Council to be chaired by the head of state with other members being a civilian vice-head of state, service chiefs, inspector general of police, one representative each from NLC, NUJ, NBA, and NANS.A curfew is hereby imposed from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. until further notice. All members of the armed forces and the police forces are hereby confined to their respective barracks.All unlawful and criminal acts by those attempting to cause chaos will be ruthlessly crushed. Be warned as we are prepared at all costs to defend the new order.All radio stations are hereby advised to hook on permanently to the national network programme until further notice.Long live all true patriots of this great country of ours. May God and Allah through his bountiful mercies bless us all”.https://www.vanguardngr.com/2020/04/flashback-speech-presented-by-major-gideon-orkar-on-april-22-1990/amp/","If The Okar Coup Had Been Successful, Will Nigeria Be Great By Now?"

652,"By 2023: Jonathan has finally made up his mind to re-contest presidency: SourceBy 247ureports - May 11, 2022 Barely 48 hours after disassociating himself from moves by some groups to draft him into the 2023 presidential race, former President Goodluck Jonathan has finally made up his mind to vie for the top post.Nigeria is set to go to the polls next year in a crowded contest parading many contestants in both the ruling APC and several opposition parties, including the main opposition PDP.On May 9, Jonathan had rejected presidential expression of interest and nomination forms bought for him by people, described as nomadic Fulani pastoralists and Almajiri communities. He was quoted as saying that it was an insult for people to buy the form for him without his consent but the former president has now made u-turn on the issue.A dependable source in Jonathan’s camp, who pleaded anonymity said that the former president had indeed, joined the APC formally, having registered at his Otuoke Ward in Bayelsa.The source disclosed that Jonathan was expected to submit his completed APC expression of interest and nomination forms bought for him earlier in the week by Fulani groups and pastoralist communities on Thursday.According to the source, the former president has secured the support of the required number of APC delegates from across the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory.“Several bigwigs of the party have also been calling Jonathan to pledge their loyalty and support to the former president,’’ the source revealed.The source told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) political correspondent late on Wednesday that some influential African leaders had called Jonathan earlier on Monday to advise him “to contest the election in the interest of Nigeria.“At least three top African leaders called the former president on the matter. They all urged him to run.“One of them specifically told him that it didn’t make sense travelling all over Africa settling disputes only to shy away from leadership responsibility in his home country.“Another reminded him of the implication of failing to put the experiences he garnered as a former Nigerian president and as a continental statesman to good use,” the source added but did not mention the names of the African leaders.The source cited some of the African leaders as telling Jonathan that Nigeria was passing through challenging times and “needed a unifier like Jonathan at this time’’.Jonathan, who lost power to incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari, was born in 1957 in the Ogbia district in Bayelsa State.He was previously of the PDP party on whose platform he ruled Nigeria until he lost the presidential election to Buhari in 2015.https://gazettengr.com/just-in-jonathan-joins-apc-in-bayelsa-finally-accepts-presidential-nomination-forms-from-fulani-group/",Breaking News!!

Last I checked there are more southerners in the race notably Osinbanjo and Tinubu.I recall when a Yoruba woman and member of RCCG was lynched and beheaded in Kubwa area of Abuja by a Muslim mob for daring to carry out Christian envagelism on the streets using a megaphone.Osinbanjo was acting President at the time of the woman's murder as Buhari was away on medical leave attending to his prostrates in the UK.Osinbanjo did not issue a statement on his fellow church member's barbaric murder despite the news going viral for days.Even Tinubu's pastor wife of the same RCCG did not say anything despite her being a ranking Senator.Their daddy GO was also silent and never said a word.It was only after several weeks that Osinbanjo issued a statement on the need for religious tolerance in the aftermath of a clash involving Shiites and Sunnis in Kaduna .In his statement on the intra-sectarian violence,  Osinbanjo stated that ""no religion is better than any other"". This is coming from a supposed Christian pastor who is suppose to be an ambassador to Christ and preach the gospel of Christ as the true and only way.What is then the point of having the likes of Osinbanjo to balance the religious diversity in the presidency ? Why then do we subscribe to a Muslims Christian presidency when cowards like Osinbanjo do nor do anything within their arrived powers and positions to protect the interests and allay the fears of their religious persuasion?As far as I am concerned not one single aspirant from the south be him a Muslim or Christian is yet to condemn this senseless killings . This ought to tell you the level of cowardice among these pretenders.As for Osinbanjo he remains the worst. A hypocrite and a fake pastor to boot.

This was occupied by a gruesome video of her stone beaten body laying helplessly on the ground, before it was burned. What was her crime? Apparently, she'd told her coursemates that there group chat was made not for religious teachings, but for studies. They way-laid her, with the help of some females, stoned her, and proceeded to burn her body. Is Islam a threat to our existence as a nation? None of the prominent northern Elite has come out to condemn this crime against humanity.

673,"Okowa tasks Nigerians on democratic sustainability Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta has called on Nigerians to participate actively in the political process to ensure good governance and democratic sustainability in the country. He stated this on Thursday in Asaba at a two-day Seminar/Workshop on ""Good Governance and Democratic Sustainability vis-a-vis Electoral Process"" organised by the Asaba Correspondents' Chapel of Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ), Delta State Council. Represented by the Commissioner for Information, Mr Charles Aniagwu, the governor said that it was imperative for Nigerians to participate in the political process to enthrone credible leadership in the country at all times. According to him, you as citizens need to participate in politics because when you don't vote, you have inadvertently voted for those who are coming to do the wrong thing. ""Once you are 18 years and above, you need to register and have your voters card and come out to cast your vote on election days. ""Once you have done that you have ended up helping in the sustainability of democracy in the country,"" he said. The governor appealed to seminar participants to take the message home to members of their families saying ""God will not come down to vote if you don't prepare to vote. ""The people get the leadership they deserve, meaning that if you don't vote you would have ended up voting for the wrong people.""  He commended the Guest Speaker, Senator Shehu Sani, for his outspokeness and contributions to the growth and sustainability of democracy in Nigeria, describing him as a ""firebrand leader and a man who speaks truth to power"". He lauded journalists in the state for their support and commitment to the dissemination of information on his administration’s programmes and policies to the people. ""As a government, we are pleased with members of the Asaba Correspondents Chapel and other journalists in the state because they have supported us in the last seven years, propagating our programmes and polices to the people. ""I speak authoritatively because I have had cause to relate with you all and you believed in honesty and had continued to tell the story just the way they are. ""We are very much aware of the overtures of the opposition to get you to tell stories that are at variance with the state of affairs especially with the N150billion bridging finance facility. ""We do not begrudge those who reason along that trajectory because they do not understand what governance is all about. ""Okowa’s mandate will expire on May 29, 2023 and until the expiration of that day he will continue to work until the last day. He said his administration has successfully completed over 850 roads spanning 1,650km and line drainages across the 25 local government areas in the state. ""We have also directly empowered over 10,000 Deltans because we believe that it will reflate our economy and improve the standard of living of Deltans ""Currently we are vigorously building 10 Model Technical Colleges in addition to the existing 6 we rehabilitated and we hope to  inaugurate them before we leave office,"" he said. The governor further remarked that the political appointees he engaged have helped in expanding the frontiers of democratic governance. ""In 2015 when we came on board Delta was 4th position in oil production but today we are number one oil producing state in the country. ""We became number one not because we acquired new oil wells but because we got a number of youths involved in productive services and hence the peace we are having today in the state,"" he stated. Guest Speaker, Senator Shehu Sani said Nigeria's democracy was not a gift given by the military but a product of struggle and sacrifice. He said Nigeria was effectively under full time military rule from 1983 to 1999 where the military forced themselves on power and commended the role played by Professor Wole Soyinka, Gani Fawehinmi, Col Abubakar Umar, Beko Ransome-Kuti among others ""Nigeria's democracy is a product of the blood and sacrifice of many who fought for it and so we have a duty to protect and preserve it. ""We cannot continue to do what we used to do when our population was small and now that we are over 200million people. In today Nigeria, people prepare for elections as if they are preparing for war because most leaders don't see political office as an opportunity to serve but a position to conquer the people. He said the only way to achieve peace in the country is by ensuring equity, justice, fairness and treating every Nigerian as a stakeholder in the country. ""If leaders behave as religious or ethnic champions then they are sowing seeds of discord. Only justice, equity and fairness that can keep the country one,"" he added. He accused the ruling All Progressives Congress APC as a clueless and failed party who never fulfilled all the promises made to Nigerians in 2015. ""The APC said PDP destroyed the country but ironically 70 percent of members of the APC today came from the PDP so they have also been part of the problem. ""The APC failed on all the promises they made to Nigerians since 2015 and almost everything the ruling party accused the former government of, they are also doing presently. ""In Kaduna state today, only two out of the 23 local governments in the state are free from bandits and kidnappers. ""Kidnapping for ransom has become a daily occurrence in the Northern part of the country where people sell their farms or homes to pay ransom for their kidnapped loved ones. The ruling political party has failed in their promises to restore law and order and we have seen how lives have been lost not just civilians but police, soldiers and other security personnel. The APC government has so far spent N4.2Tr for Defence and Security in 7 years yet insecurity has remained unabated. ""We spent $1billion to purchase Tucano jets and this has not stopped kidnapping, banditry and terrorism in the country. ""The terrorists are only armed with motorcycles and Ak-47, yet we keep pumping billions of dollars into security and defence without achieving results. ""Kidnappers call relatives for ransom with Nigerian registered aims but yet no trace of anyone arrested,"" He said the only legacy the government can leave for the people is to secure their lives, saying ""the people are not even asking to be lifted out of poverty but to secure their lives while they manage their poverty. On the nation's precarious economy, he accused the ruling party of accumulating debts and took a swipe at the National Assembly for approving all loans requested by the Buhari administration without proper use. ""The National Assembly is now a rubber stamp because they approved $35billion dollars in two years for the Buhari administration yet we can't see what they have done with the money."" He described the PDP as too elitist and too timid to come out to protest all the evil happenings in the country. ""The PDP has forgotten what the APC did to them in the past, If the PDP is desirous of taking over power from the APC, there must be unity among themselves and they have the people to do it. ""I say this because 80 percent of the people vying for the presidency of this country are not serious. ""Why should people accept quota system and reject rotational power? Those who accept quota system should also accept zoning,"" Sani added. The former Senator said democracy could only be sustained if we can ensure free, fair and transparent elections, adding ""it's difficult for good people to emerge because the whole process is monetised, people buy their positions,"" he said He said the payment of N100m to purchase nomination forms will end up encouraging kidnapping, because no matter how good you are you can't be anything until you have money to share for the people. ""As we move towards the 2023 elections, the ruling party has nothing more to offer they should leave us in peace and allow Nigerians to grapple with their problems as long as they don't have bandits and terrorists harrasing them. ""The reality is before us as Nigeria is now the poverty capital of the world, farmers cannot go to their farms without paying taxes to terrorists ""Don't think because people are suffering that they would vote out the ruling party, if you are not united it will be difficult to oust them. ""The most critical voter in Nigeria is the Northern poor and they are in millions, they don't vote because they are suffering, they vote where their leaders asked them to vote. If we want this country to remain as one, we have to treat each other with respect and dignity and you can't continue to hold people to ransom for the civil war that happened many years ago. ""If people have lost hope in the ruling party then they are expecting and hoping that the opposition would do better. ""As we move towards the 2023 general elections, Nigerians have a duty to do what is right by electing leaders who can perform and restore law and order in the country ""All we need is a leader with capacity, competence and experience and the people around you who share in your vision,"" he stated. Welcoming guests earlier, Chairman of the Chapel, Dominic Adewole, said the theme of the Workshop was carefully chosen as part of deliberate effort to broaden the discourse on the fast approaching 2023 general election in the country. He added that the success of next year's election is largely dependent on the observance of the provisions of the new Electoral Act by the umpire, INEC, and political stakeholders. ""With the political atmosphere at a fever pitch as the nation marches towards yet another dispensation in the democratic process, this topic couldn't have come at a more appropriate time. ""It is with this in mind that this seminar has been put together to sensitise stakeholders on their roles in the new law as we approach 2023,"" he stated. The seminar was attended by Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Olisa Ifeajika, State Chairman of NUJ, Comrade Michael Ikeogwu, representative of the State Commissioner Police Mr Mohammed Ari among others.",Okowa Tasks Nigerians On Democratic Sustainability

683,"Have you ever realized that Nigerians generally have no real grasp of how much money our “leaders” are embezzling and laundering? Have you ever thought of how much six hundred & twenty eight million naira, five hundred million naira, two billion naira and other similar massive amounts of money that politicians are frequently accused and proven to steal is worth? Kindly follow my train of thought and bring out a calculator to punch the figures yourselves so that you’ll understand my point fully. According to several widely known and reliable sources, the average Nigerian lives on less than a dollar per day. This means that the average Nigerian makes or survives on about 30 dollars(less than 5000 naira) every month. That means the average Nigerian earns 60 thousand naira per annum. It would take such a person more than 1,500 years to gross 100,000,000.00 naira. For the sake of better clarity and understanding, permit me to adjust that value a bit. If you are reading this, chances are high you are one of the fortunate middle class Nigerians who have access to the internet and own a personal computer or at least have access to one. That means the idea of earning less than 5000 naira monthly is quite unthinkable to you. In fact if you are a working class person, I daresay that you have probably spent 5000 naira yesterday or the last two days combined. As such, you probably earnanywhere within 70, 000 naira to 150,000 naira or more. It doesn’t matter if you do not agree with those figures; I have just chosen them as dummy values to prove my point, just read on and you can tweak the values as much as you wish when you finish reading. Now, picking a random value, let us say, 100,000 naira for ease of calculation. As someone born, bred and still living in Nigeria, I know, that anyone who earns 100,000 naira is doing fairly well for himself; after all, the minimum wage the federal government pays is 18,000 naira! 100,000 naira multiplied by 12 months in a year is 1.2 million naira. Dear reader, do you realize that it will take someone earning 100,000 naira monthly almost 90 years to gross (without deductions) 1 hundred million naira. Do you “overstand” what I’m saying yet? Okay, let try a higher figure just for the sake of better comprehension- a 500,000 naira salary. A 5 hundred thousand naira salary is “as good as it gets” in Nigeria, yet even an individual earning so much earns just 6 million naira per annum. This means it will take such an individual about 17 years of toiling and hard work to gross 1 hundred million naira. Let’s even get wild about it, say someone who earns 1 million naira monthly (Let’s be honest with ourselves, how many people earn so much? How many people do you personally know who earn so much?). That person will earn 12 million naira yearly and gross 1 hundred million naira after 9 long years. I hope we haven’t forgotten that those figures are gross figures i.e. no deductions were made. This is apparently an impossible situation as every human being has to satisfy his/her basic and not-so-basic human needs and responsibilities of feeding, housing, clothing, transportation, providing quality education to his/her children, taking care of extended family members, giving to charity and religious institutions, entertainment and the plethora of activities that we engage in as humans. An objective calculation will show that it is quite frankly, almost impossible to save more than 20% of annual income, especially for low income earners whose salary cannot even meet up with their expenses. My point in summary is this, our leaders are “swallowing”, both through legal and illegal means amounts of money that will take the average and even well to do Nigerian 3 or 4 lifetimes to net. I took a look at the proposed budget for 2013 and of course as typical with our “budgets”. Even the most meager things hit the hundred million naira mark. For example, the President wants to spend over 200 million naira on refreshments and meals while his Vice wants over 100 million naira- just for one year! I’m also sure that we remember that the expenditure to maintain the garden in Aso rock was about 200 million naira. These are amounts of money we have shown that it would take multiple lifetimes for the everyday Nigerian to gross, yet these amounts are been “swallowed” daily in the corners of power within minutes. I hope that by recognizing this facts, we would understand why our leaders are so insulated from the suffering of the general populace (They are too comfortable, way too comfortable) and appreciate better how much we are been ripped off when next we hear a politician has “swallowed’ any amount running into hundreds of millions of naira. Politicians gross hundreds of millions in one day, it will take you & me several lifetimes to do the same. “One day, bush meat go catch the hunter……”",Is 100 Million Naira Really So Much?!

687,"Business Insider Africa presents 20 African countries with the most expensive prices of mobile data.This list is courtesy of Statista, as we relied on data provided by the research firm and dated December 2021.Earlier, we reported about the agitation by Nigerian telecom operators to increase the prices of the services, a development that was met with uproar across the country. Just in case you missed that, the telcos wrote the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to demand an upward review of the prices of data, call and SMS; citing higher cost of doing business. Needless to say that Nigerians weren't too pleased with the demand.The development piqued our curiosity to find out how much people in other parts of Africa are paying for telecom services.We particularly sought to find out whether Nigeria is among the most expensive countries in Africa to buy mobile data. Well, as it turns out, the country currently has one of the cheapest prices of mobile data on the continent.Some interesting factsAccording to Statista, about 480 million Africans currently have access to mobile internet. These are 480 million people who must buy data either on a daily, weekly or monthly basis in order to remain connected to the world wide web. Interestingly, these people do not all pay the same prices for the service, as you will see shortly.It should be noted that African countries generally have some of the most expensive costs of mobile data in the world. The aforementioned source (i.e., Statista) explained that the high cost is due to various factors, including unavailability of infrastructure and high taxation in the African telecom industry.20 African countries with the most expensive prices of mobile dataThat said, we shall now focus on the 20 African countries with the most expensive average prices of mobile data. The list is based on a stats from Statista dated December 2021. See the list below.Equatorial Guinea: This country currently has the most expensive price of mobile data, with one gigabyte costing as much as $49.67.Sao Tome and Principe: Here, one gigabyte data would cost you $30.97.Malawi: Malawians pay the third most expensive price of mobile data in Africa at $25.46 per gigabyte.Chad: This Sahelian African country has the fourth most expensive price of mobile data at $23.33.Namibia: People in Namibia spend an average of $22.37 to buy one gigabyte data.Central African Republic: In CAR, the average price for one gigabyte data is $9.03.Seychelles: This island African country comes in at number seven with an average price of $8.64 per gigabyte data.Gambia: The average price for one gigabyte data in Gambia is $5.86.Mauritania: The average price for one gigabyte data is in this West African country is $5.56.Madagascar: In this country, the average price for one gigabyte data is $5:14.Gabon: The average price for one gigabyte data in Gabon is $4.82.Cape Verde: Here, the average price for one gigabyte data is $4.78.Togo: Togolese spend an average of $4.69 to buy one gigabyte data.Burkina Faso: Here, the average price for one gigabyte data is $4.52.Guinea-Bissau: The average price for one gigabyte data in this country is $4.41.Botswana: Botswanans spend an average of $3.92 for one gigabyte data.Benin: People in Benin Republic spend an average of $3.61 for one gigabyte data.Mali: In this country, the average price of one gigabyte data is $3.28.Sierra Leone: Here, the average price for one gigabyte data is $3.26.Comoros: Here, the average price for one gigabyte data is $3.21.BONUS: The average price for one gigabyte data in Nigeria is $0.88.https://africa.businessinsider.com/local/markets/20-african-countries-with-the-most-expensive-average-prices-of-mobile-data/78zbt7m",20 African Countries With The Most Expensive Average Prices Of Mobile Data

690,"The Central Bank of Nigeria has not made public its annual reports since 2018, a move analysts say is aimed at concealing mismanagement at the top bank.In gross contravention of its own laws, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has repeatedly failed to release its annual reports showing details of its operations and financial obligations.Since 2005 when it started publishing details of its annual report on its website, the CBN never failed to publish the report until 2018 when it stopped the publication of the crucial documents.According to the CBN Act 2007, the apex bank is expected to publish its report within two months after the end of each financial year.""The Bank shall, within two months after the close of each financial year, transmit to the National Assembly and the President a copy of its annual accounts certified by the Auditor,"" the CBN Act reads in part.""A report required to be submitted to the National Assembly and the President shall be published by the Bank in such manner as the Governor may direct.""The Board shall ensure that accounts submitted pursuant to this section shall as soon as possible be published in the Gazette.""The Bank shall as soon as may be practicable after the last day of each month makeup end publish a return of its assets and liabilities as at the close of business on that day, or if that day is a holiday, as at the close of business on the last preceding business day,"" the Act reads.Analysts say that the failure of the CBN to publish the report could send wrong signals to investors and others interested in understanding the state of the economy.In recent years, the CBN has faced criticisms regarding the management of the country's economy.Amid skyrocketed food prices and other inflationary pressures, the apex bank has kept the country's interest rate at 11.5 percent since September 2020 when the CBN reduced the monetary policy rate from 12.5 percent.The bank has also been struggled to ensure liquidity amid depleting reserves. It has also been criticised for its management of the naira and its controversial financing of the federal government's deficits.Paul Alaje, an economist and policy analyst, said that no one knows what the intention of the CBN is but publishing the annual reports would have helped the country to know its fiscal condition.According to him, although some suggestions are left out during the monetary policy meetings, the report will be helpful for those who want to do further research.""It is also setting our country back because if we don't know what is obtainable in the past we may not know the kind of policy to apply in the future,"" he said.""Make the report public except and unless the CBN is saying there has been no activity within the institution for the period of time"".The bank did not respond to an FOI filed by PREMIUM TIMES requesting details of the annual reports. Its spokesperson, Osita Nwasinobi, did not respond to calls seeking comment.Red Flags?Other analysts say the Godwin Emefiele-led CBN has failed to open its books largely because of its poor management of the nation's treasury and the massive funding of government deficit.In 2017, a member of the Monetary Policy Committee, Doyin Salami took a swipe at the apex bank for pushing the country towards a serious economic crisis.He criticised the CBN's ""massive injections of cash"" to the government, accusing the bank of serving as a ""piggy bank"" for the government, against its own rules.""Monetary data shows a sharp rise in the extent of CBN financing of the government deficit,"" he had said.According to the economist, beginning from 2016, the CBN had made cash available to the federal government running into trillions, mostly beyond legal thresholds.He said the CBN's claims on the federal government under the period amounted to N814 billion, which was ""twentyfold higher"" than what the law permits.The CBN dismissed the claim at the time but has since continued to deploy the Ways and Means facility to finance the country's deficit.At a public presentation of the 2020 approved budget in January, Nigeria's Minister for Finance, Zainab Ahmed, revealed that revenue shortfall and increased expenditure resulted in a fiscal deficit of about N6.1 trillion as against the N4.6 trillion budgeted by the government.The minister revealed that the deficit was financed with a N2 trillion borrowing from the domestic market, a N1.2 trillion from foreign markets, and a N2.8 trillion obtained from the CBN. The CBN's intervention came in the form of Ways and Means, as provided for in the CBN Act.Experts, global financial institutions, and rating agencies have continually warned of the danger the CBN's intervention portends for the macroeconomic stability of the country.In its 2018 report, the bank's last published report, the apex bank said the country's economy showed considerable resilience during the year, especially when compared to its peers.""Overall GDP growth quickened to 1.9 percent in 2018 from 0.8 percent in 2017. Though this growth rate is below the pre-recession average of over 5.0 percent, the positive outturn which reflected the continued rebound of the Nigerian economy is gratifying,"" the report said.'Partisan Regulator'Meanwhile, amid widespread criticism of its handling of the naira and other monetary policies, the governor of the bank, Godwin Emefiele, has come under serious fire for getting involved in partisan politics.In the last few weeks, several campaign groups have come out to campaign for the election of Mr Emefiele as Nigeria's next president.The campaign infuriated many Nigerians, who called for his resignation or outright dismissal. But in his reaction , Mr Emefiele said that he was focused on strengthening the nation's economy.Things took a dramatic turn when on May 5 Mr Emefiele filed a suit at the Federal High Court in Abuja through his lawyer, Mike Ozekhome, contesting his eligibility to run for Nigeria's president while in office as the CBN governor. He argued that no law exempted him from contesting the primary election of any political party as a sitting CBN governor.Although the case is still in court, many Nigerians have pilloried the CBN Governor for desecrating his sensitive position as chief custodian of the apex bank.""Godwin Emefiele has ridiculed the office of the Central Bank Governor,"" Kalu Aja, an economist, noted.""He lacks any moral authority to oversee the monetary policy or external reserves of Nigeria.""He is essentially deploying the Ways and Means privileges to fund his political ambition. He should resign.""Source: https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/528931-amid-massive-funding-of-govts-deficits-cbn-refuses-to-publish-annual-reports.htmlFront page: Lalasticlala Mynd44","Amid Massive Funding Of Govt's Deficits, CBN Refuses To Publish Annual Reports"

The same APC that claimed that GEJ was responsible for all the evil that pervaded the land before the 2015 elections?  Come to think of it, what did GEJ forget in Aso Rock that he desperately wants to retrieve? Could this be an attempt by GEJ to spite the likes of Amaechi, Tinubu, Silva, and many others that made him look so stupid and worthless a few years ago? Or, has he suddenly become a miracle worker that will fix the mess of Buhari in 4yrs? Lol.....some of us that were his ardent supporters knew his limitations, he has no such superpowers. Honestly, I'm utterly disappointed. Goodluck Jonathan did not just rob stinking dirt on the faces of many of us who are his diehard supporters but he also proved that behind his gentle mien lies a selfish, power-hungry, and crafty betrayer. The fact that he was pretending and 'forming' uninterested makes the whole most annoying. GEJ, it is sad you allowed yourself to be used to undermine the the Southern Nigeria. I know it is within your rights to aspire for any leadership position in Nigeria but this move is not only going to mark the beginning of your demystification, but it also will mark the beginning of your grace to grass journey.

701,"If you let a bull into a china shop you are expecting the bull to wreck all the china.This is why the West chose Buhari as their anointed candidate not to rule Nigeria but to oversee Nigeria's dissolution.The perfect Manchurian Kandidate is one who you know will do what you expect from him not because of the brainwashing but the fact that you understand his personae and character enough to ensure that he will do what you expect of him. This is the simple summary of the character and divisive nature of Muhammadu Buhari. The West are no strangers to Buhari's sectionalism and bigotry and over the years since Buhari was kicked out of Dodan Barracks, Buhari has had time to become more radicalized in both his parochial sectionalism and bigotry to the point that he floated a regional northern party on his own - Congress for Progressive Change. So the excuse that the west may have made a mistake in supporting Buhari is totally out of the question as they knew very well before hand what a candidate like Muhamdu Buhari represented before throwing their weight behind him.When Buhari made the quote; ""I belong to nobody but belong to everybody"" he was in effect telling us that he is nothing but a puppet at the hands of many a puppeteers. Buhari's many puppeteers are;1. Hardline Northern supremacists usually sharia advocates. These set of scammers are working in tandem with the Saudi Wahabbi group  are just out to make a buck both from Saudi Arabia and to garner influence from within the Nigerian govt. This set of religious bigots where highly influential in redirecting Nigeria's foreign policy towards Saudi Arabia and pitching us against Israel and Iran. They also played a major role in the Zaria massacre of shiites and are the hawks advocating and pushing for war in the Niger Delta (in the guise of fighting Militants) and SE (in the guise of curbing Biafran secessionists). 2. Hardline Northern Military officers from the Abacha era. These set of retired and serving Military officers are using Military comradeship in swaying Buhari. They are out to make a buck like the sharia advocates above. They have no ideological input into Buhari's administration but are using their army links to back Buhari in whatever foolish decision he makes all because they want him to award juicy contracts and oil lifting rights to them. They are the force behind the NDA.3. Northern Sycophants . These set of political jobbers have been with Buhari since he decided back in 2003 to contest for the highest office. They are drawn mainly from the Abacha era and have been in the cold dark corridors of political limbo since Abacha's demise. These set of political jobbers dominate Buhari's inner cabinet and are by far the greatest puppeteers of the Buhari puppet as they have 24/7 access to him night and day. 4. Northern Business Oligarchs. Drawn from the Abacha and Yaradua era these set of northerners are selling the idea that before the north can surpass the south, the south must be slowed down. All Buhari's disastrous policies have been felt first and only in the south. The several companies folding up and mass sacking of staff is occurring mainly in the south, Why? Because there are no tangible private firms located in the north. These set of greedy oligarchs are using Buhari's distorted financial and economic policies to mop up cheapened shares from the stock market. The brain dead forex policy is just an avenue at round-tripping that has made many an ab0ki extremely rich overnight. Considering the skewed ethnic and regional makeup of Buhari's inner cabinet you will all agree that most of those who surround Buhari are actually northerners pushing a northern agenda and they are achieving their goals because Buhari as president remains a willing tool at their hands because of his highly sectional approach and gross ignorance.",Buhari: The Perfect Manchurian Candidate

Now, as seen above, we have a new online poll which as at this morning, the VP is leading.The honest truth is, our vote on this poll does not matter. The only vote that matters right now is the delegate vote, and unless you are an APC or PDP member and delegate to the primaries, your vote here does not count....and even if you are, you only have one vote.You cannot vote ten times for Atiku, Obi, Tinubu and Osibanjo or Saraki, etal.And the VP may not win the APC delegates vote, nor would he become president. He is not the strongest candidate in the field. Yet, he won online because most Nigerians online who are educated and intelligent identfy with him. Same for Obi. But both of them may not win their respective party primaries...so this vote will become useless in 30 days time.....So, get your PVC, go and vote on the day, and don't bother yerself about this online poll.

We wish to categorically restate that the President will step down on May 29, 2023, after serving two terms – as per the constitution.“Having been the first recipient of a democratic transfer of power from an incumbent administration to an opposition candidate in Nigerian history, the President is committed to extending and entrenching democratic values across the country.“He shall, in turn, hand the privilege of serving the people of Nigeria to whomever they choose through free, fair and credible elections.“However, Chief Clarke is right to say that without security, Nigeria would not likely realize its true potential as a peaceful and prosperous nation. That is why it has been at the core of this administration. The results are there for all to see. Boko Haram have been forced back from controlling whole swathes of this country. Internally Displaced Persons are now returning to rebuild their communities.“These achievements have been accomplished through the bravery and determination of the Nigerian armed forces and the fortitude of the people of our nation.“New challenges have arisen and tackled in turn – whether it’s the National Livestock Transformation Plan to alleviate herder-farmer clashes, the elimination of the leadership of ISWAP, or new efforts to combat banditry. Till the last day of the administration, the security of the citizens shall remain the administration’s paramount concern.“We shall finish the job. Yet, in any case, respect for the constitution and Nigerians’ democratic rights remains the best path to securing and then maintaining peace.“Yet there are others, such as Chief Afe Babalola, that believe elections should be suspended, with the current elected government replaced by an interim unelected administration.“This, he claims, is necessary to create a new constitution for the people, made possible, paradoxically, by ignoring their democratic rights. Down that path lies crisis and instability.“Instead, this administration proposes something entirely simpler: honouring the constitution and people’s right to decide.”Source: https://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/05/buhari-wont-stay-beyond-may-29-2023-presidency/","Buhari Won’t Stay Beyond May 29, 2023 – Presidency"

He is so full of himself and very arrogant without looking at the other side of the story.He feels he is the best man in the world. Governance is all about Teamwork. You think in terms of others. As Governor he fought with the Chief Judge of Rivers, he Fought with former Rivers State Commissioner of Police, Mbu to a standstill. He fought his close associate Nyesom Wike , the Governor of Rivers State and the aftermath caused APC to loose Rivers State to PDP to the extent that APC was not on the ballot in 2019. It was a colossal loss and since then APC Rivers has never been the same again. My personal encounter with Hon Amaechi was in 2019 at Teslim Balogun Stadium Lagos. President BUHARI came to campaign in Lagos. I think Hon Amaechi was heading the Campaign Organization then. As the Pub Sec of APC Lagos I was on the podium with other speakers and MCs. As soon as it was announced that President is coming Hon Amaechi began to chase people away from the stage. He came to me and asked me to leave. I told him that Iam the Pub Sec of APC Lagos I needed to be where I am . He flew up said: “If you do not leave here now I will unleash Soldiers on you. My Children, three of them were on the gallery watching with curiosity. When I saw his eyes I needed nobody to tell me to leave because my boys would have felt bad and humiliated if soldiers descend on me. I quietly left the stage. Hon Amaechi rattled me and I was shocked to the marrows. He could not even listen to any explanation or what you want to say. He had his way in Lagos where I hold fort. There was also another similar event in 2019 at Agege Stadium Lagos organized by Hausa/Fulani in Lagos led by Hon Kabiru Mohammed , now Commissioner for Water front Lagos for President Buhari. As soon as Hon Amaechi arrived he ordered all the leaders of AREWA Community in who were already on the Podium to step down.  Kabiru stood his ground. He told Hon Amaechi  that they used their money to organize the event and therefore cannot be harassed out of the podium. It was a big harassment but Kabiru stood his ground and did not leave even when other leaders scampered away. What point am l making here? A good leader listens, he bows to superior arguments, he treats people well , he thinks in terms of others, he recognizes the rights of others, he loves teamwork, he is a problem solver, he makes friends easily, he loves without condition, he allows free speech, he is not all knowing , he pays attention to details , he identifies talents and reward them accordingly.

712,"Over the years, the principal role of town planning authority is to develop quality urban designs and to ensure even development in all parts of Lagos metropolis.Essentially, the town planning department is a major catalyst in bringing out the beauty of Lagos. Therefore, they are more like pivotal development partners in every state; most especially, when it has to do with a critical sector like the construction industry. This is so due to the multiplier effects the industry has on the economy, including job creation.However, lots of developers in Lagos are currently complaining bitterly that they are facing multi facets frustrations under the administration of the Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Dr Idris Okanla Salako, citing unwholesome activities and corrupt practices allegedly going on in the department brazenly.In an interview with our reporter, a top developer who pleaded anonymity alleged that Salako has brazenly turned the critical department of town planning to only revenue making channels, while totally abandoning the due processes and the core objectives of why the critical department was created.The stakeholder said “Due to the understanding of the sector, under the government of former Governor Babatunde Fashola; the physical planning department was pre-occupied with its core objectives;. It had a friendly outlook and had a robust relationship with all critical partners and developers.“The relationship with major stakeholders under Ex-Governor Fashola was so solid in such a way that there used to be monthly stakeholders’ meeting and collection of data from developers with a view to ascertaining jobs creation and development.“Also, under Fashola regime, quality development was the order of the day in the physical planning, and it was emphasized as a core objective. This development mid-wifed Lagos State Building Control Agency, LASBCA and Lagos State Physical Planning Permit Authority, LASPPPA. These two agencies are saddled with the responsibility of ensuring quality control and uniform planning under Governor Fashola. The purpose of creating them was to speed up the approval processes of building permit.He added that to ensure efficiency, * the administration ordered the two main agencies to be working on Saturdays. The synergy was so cordial in such a way that both the agencies and the stskeoilders learnt a lot from each other. The sole purpose was to make sure Lagos becomes beautiful and be a model to other states.“When Fashola left in 2015 and the government of Akinwumi Ambode came on board, the template continued and tried to improving on what he met on ground.The top stakeholder lanented that under the present governernt of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Salako-led administration has made things go awry in the physical planning department as a result of sharp practices, nepotism and desperation to generate funds by all means.He said ” Under this administration, the man at the helm of affairs in the Lagos State Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban Development, Idris Salako, has made the town planning authority abandon its core purpure of establishment. To the amazement of we stakeholders, Salako has made the department to derail completely by introducing revenue as the core function of the ministry as against the main objectives of quality and development.According to him, lots of construction players are currently groaning under Salako-led administration because of the high degree of frustrations they are deliberately made to pass through so as to satisfy some selfish interests.He saidI “In order to be in good books of Governor Sanwo-Olu and to be seen as one with the highest in revenue collection, he placed officers on target, mostly unrealistic targets; so as to be boasting of being one of the highest in revenue commissioner. However, it has been revealed that the idea is a daytime fraud.“To perpetrate their acts, the module operandi is to ensure that offices are increased and charge discretionary fees Developers are charged high fees. If such developer can’t meet up in paying the fees, Salako would give room to negotiations. He would discount the fees. Even at that, the developer would soon part away with money. Failure to do so may backfire on the developer.“In order to generate income, the Commissioner would be sealing buildings indiscriminately, requesting for building permits. Even the developers that met up with the requirements were made to undergo series of frustrations by citing all forms of technicalities just to ensure they cough out money illegally,” he added.The expert also revealed how some workers of the ministry used to invade the sites of developers who failed to “cooperate”.“Like thugs, some workers would invade the construction sited in a Gestapo style, chased everybody out, and in some cases, arrested and dragged construction workers to court on ridiculous and trumpped-up charges.The purpose of thossy scenes is to instil fears in the minds of players in the construction industry,” he lamented.He greatly lamented that the key stakeholders in the construction industry in Lagos are currently finding it difficult to breathe under Salako-led team,; which, according to him has priotized mainly on personal income against the key objective of bringing out the beauty of Lagos State as the commercial capital of Nigeria.He also noted that the absymsal failure of Salako’s is one of the factors responsible for the frequent rate of building collapse in Lagos.Also speaking with our reporter, a staff of the ministry who does not want name to be mention because of the sensitive nature the matter said that they are told to lure the developers to pay money when the ministry actually know that they are not ready to grant you permit; and that money would never be refunded. He added that this is part of the strategies given to them to meet up with ‘revenue targets’“This gives credence to reason under his leadership why collapsed buildings, staff low moral, nepotism have become order of the day under the Ministry. Even we staff are groaning, they can’t wait for him to end his tenure. Stakeholders can’t bear the yokes anymore being that despite the 7-day issuance of obtaining permit remains more difficult than collecting oil well permit under the Federal Governmen.Lamenting further, the staff revealed that Salako would also ensure that third party consultants close to the ministry are used to package the documents of developers, noting that the motive is part of their endemic corrupt practices..“The people enjoying Salako are the players with the same corrupt mindset who are ready to compromise and grease his pocket. That is one of the reasons why building are collapsing across Lagos because the structures are in variance with the total violation of required architectural designs,” the staff added.As part of the duties of the media to investigate issues, the Infrastructurenews.ng has begun the audit of all defective buildings as they litter Lagos; and this will come out in our next publication.We are also calling on Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to critically revise and evaluate the matter and get a third party assessment to ensure that allegations of woeful performance would not crop up in his second term.",It Is Hard To Get Housing Permit In Lagos Than Oil License Under Idris Salakol

715,"2023 Presidency: Fear of Amaechi's Imminent Electoral Victory, Behind Sneaky Insertion of Section 84(12) into the New Electoral Act ~ Eze  ...Commends Court of Appeal, Abuja Division For Declaring the Section a Blatant Violation of Constitutional Provisions and thus, Null and Void   ...Says Ruling Vindicates President Buhari and Others Who Spoke Against the Humongous Error Chieftain of the All Progressives Congress and erstwhile National Publicity Secretary of the defunct New People’s Democratic Party, (nPDP), Chief Eze Chukwuemeka, Eze has restated that the palpable gloom of apprehension which engulfed the camps of the opposition People’s Democratic Party and other individuals and groups opposed to the Presidential project of the Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, led to the inclusion of the controversial section 84(12) during the amendment process of the Electoral Act. Chief Eze stated this in reaction to the ruling of the Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja, which described the section of the new Electoral Law as unconstitutional, null and void and of no effect.  The said section 84(12) provides thus: “No political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.” In a statement made available to media houses in Abuja, Chief Eze said though the Court in its wisdom struck out the suit marked: FHC/UM/CS/26/2022, which was filed before the Umuahia court, It is however gladdening to note that the Three Man Panel of the Court of Appeal in Abuja on 11th May while delivering judgment on the appeal marked: CA/OW/87/2022 filed by the PDP, accepted the fact that Section 84(12) as being pushed by the party is illegal and inconsistent with provisions of the constitution.   The three-man panel of Justices led by Justice Hamma Akawu Barka, held that the high court, from whence the suit emanated acted without jurisdiction in the first place. The Court, while determining the appeal on the merit, held that Section 84(12) is grossly unconstitutional and inconsistent with Section 42 (1)(a) of the Constitution and denied a class of Nigerian citizens their right to participate in election. The appeal followed the judgement of the High Court in Umuahia, which in March, struck down section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, 2022 and ordered that it should be deleted by the Attorney-General of the Federation for being inconsistent with the Constitution. Eze highlighted that the blunt refusal of the National Assembly to amend the offensive section of the new law, even after the President and other enlightened Nigerians pointed out to them that the section is an attempt to deny a group of Nigerians from participating in the 2023 general elections, could be construed to mean a scheme to achieving some mischievous ends which amongst others is to fight the Nigerian project viz the Presidential aspiration of the Transportation Minister, Chibuike Amaechi.  “It is unfortunate that the National Assembly, against history, went ahead to refuse to heed to the appeal of Mr. President and some patriotic Nigerians that the section is illegal and must be amended accordingly, just because the National Assembly and those urging them on this evil mission are afraid of the candidature of Rt. Hon. Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi and a few others”, Eze stated. It would be recalled that President Muhammadu Buhari had before assenting to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2022, expressed his reservations with that portion of the electoral law, which he described as discriminatory. The party Chief however commended the red chambers for the amendment of Section 84( of the Amended Electoral Act 2022 failed to provide for the participation of statutory delegates in conventions, congresses or meetings of political parties held to nominate candidates for general elections. The move was sequel to a bill sponsored by the Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege (APC, Delta Central), as the upper chamber said the unintended error committed by the omission must be corrected before the start of party primaries next week. Eze said it would have been more beneficial if the speed the Lawmakers are exhibiting to amend section 84( was also deployed to ratify the error in (12) but commended the Court for doing the needful. Statutory delegates to congresses and conventions of political parties are elected councillors in all the over 8,000 wards across the country, elected chairmen and vice chairmen of the 774 local councils, elected members of state Houses of Assembly, elected federal lawmakers in the National Assembly, and governors of the 36 states and their deputies. Others include the President and Vice President of the country and executives of political parties at the state and federal levels as well as chairmen of parties at the local government level. Eze appealed to Nigerians particularly those in dire need of a visionary and result oriented leader like Amaechi to win the 2023 general elections to continue to pray for good to prevail over evil in Nigeria.","2023 Presidency: Fear Of Amaechi's Imminent Electoral Victory, Behind Sneaky Ins"

721,"How Vice President Osinbajo’s antecedent defeat false claims of religious bigotry and tribalism By John Tochukwu OlisaThis writer is currently reading a leadership book by Lee Kuan Yew, Former Prime Minister of Singapore, titled ‘From Third World to First World’. The book gives an insight into Lee Kuan Yew’s years of service, and how he turned around the fortunes of his country, Singapore, moving from a third world (underdeveloped) country to a first world (developed) country, within a space of just three decades.Reading through the book, one can see striking similarities between the person of Lee Kuan Yew and Professor Yemi Osinbajo. Some of the qualities both have in common are making merit-based appointments, respect for the law, respect for different tribes and religions, and non-discrimination on grounds of tribe and religion. Lee Kuan Yew achieved so much for his country, laying the foundation for modern-day Singapore; he can never be forgotten in the history of Singapore. Just as Lee Kuan Yew did in Singapore, if elected as President in 2023, it is evident that Professor Yemi Osinbajo will achieve great feats, and will lay a rock-solid foundation for the future of Nigeria. The vice president, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN),has come a long way in public service, working with people of different religious inclinations. In 1988, at age 31, he was appointed as Special Adviser to the Attorney General of the Federation, Chief Bola Ajibola, SAN, and a Southern Muslim. Professor Osinbajo held the post for 4 years, till 1992. Between 1999 and 2007, he served as Attorney General and Commissioner for Lagos of Lagos State, under the Governorship of Bola Ahmed Tinubu, another Southern Muslim. Beyond religion, Excellency, the Vice President is known to be an advocate for Meritocracy. He strongly believes that Nigeria has enough competent hands, across all religious and tribal lines that can effectively and efficiently administer the affairs of the country. This has been greatly reflected in the appointments he has made since 2015. The most senior official position in the office of the Vice President is that of the Deputy Chief of Staff to the President. The position is held by AbdulrahmanIpaye, a Southern Yoruba Muslim. A former sub-dean of the Faculty of Law, University of Lagos, Mr. Ipaye was appointed Special Assistant on Legal Affairs to Bola Tinubu in May 2001, and in 2003,he became the Governor’s Senior Special Assistant on Legal Matters; holding that post till 2007. He later served as Attorney General of Lagosstate between 2011-2015 under Governor BabatundeFashola, before his appointment in 2015 as Deputy Chief of Staff. This is meritocracy speaking, irrespective of tribe or religion.Furthermore, it should be noted that Special Advisers are next in the hierarchy of seniority in the office of the Vice President. Of the three special advisers, two are Muslims. Mrs. Maryam Uwais occupies the office of Special Adviser on Social Investments. A Northern Muslim, Mrs. Uwais is a lawyer of 42 years and has served in the Kano State Ministry of Justice, Nigerian Law Reform  Commission, Central Bank of Nigeria, National Human Rights Commission, Justice Research Institute, as well as the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the child, among others. Some of her awards include the Humanitarian of the Year Award, in 2011, from the International Women’s Society and; National Human Rights Commission Awardee, in 2015, for Outstanding Contributions in the Advancement of the Rights of Women and Children in Nigeria. Before she was appointed Special Adviser, she was a Non- Executive Director, and member of the Board of Directors of Stanbic IBTC Holdings Plc. This is meritocracy speaking, irrespective of tribe or religion.Another sound piece of evidence is the example of Ben Akabueze, a Southern Igbo Christian, who is currently the Director-General of the Budget Office. He was once the Chief Executive Officer of NAL Bank, now Sterling Bank. He served as two-term Commissioner for Economic Planning and Budget in Lagos. He thereafter served as Special Adviser on National Planning to President Buhari before he was appointed Director-General of the Budget Office. This is meritocracy speaking, irrespective of tribe or religion. Other appointees in the office of the Vice President include Ambassador AbdullahiGwary, a Northern Muslim from Yobe State, who serves as Senior Special Assistant on Foreign Affairs; Mrs. BilkisuSaidu, a Northern Muslim from Sokoto State, who serves as Senior Special Assistant on Legal Research and Compliance Matters; Mrs. Susan Changwa, a Northern Christian from Adamawa State, who serves as Special Assistant on Household and Special Events; Mrs. OlabisiOgungbemi, a Southern Muslim, who serves as Special Assistant on Political Matters; and Yusuf Ali, a Southern Muslim who serves as Special Assistant on Power. The backgrounds of these appointees reflect the all-inclusive nature of the Vice President, who picks the best for the job, irrespective of tribe or religion. In conclusion, Professor Yemi Osinbajo is a man who believes in the emergence of a New Nigeria; one in which the sole qualification needed to attain one’s dreams to serve Nigeria is merit-based, not religion or tribe. When elected in 2023 as President, Nigeria will unfailingly experience a positive turnaround.lalasticlalaMynd44Seunhttps://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/05/2023-presidency-osibanjo-meritocracy-and-all-inclusive-leadership/","2023 Presidency: Osinbajo, Meritocracy, And All-inclusive Leadership"

After killing her, her body was burnt on the school premises.”Reacting to the incident, the college directed all students to vacate its campus immediately.“Following today’s early morning Students rampage in the college, the college management has resolved to close down the college indefinitely with immediate effect.

723,"Dear Nigerian Muslims, Christians are not your Enemies""Wahhabism is nothing but an Empty Cult"" - Imam Khomeini (qs)The events of yesterday in Sokoto State and the North East of the gruesome murder of innocent Christian civilians is a call for concern for all Nigerian Muslims. And such murderous terrorism and criminality has roots in the Saudi-sponsored ideology of Wahhabism.The Terrorism-enabled Wahhabi clerics start by brainwashing their compound ignorant followers that ""Christians are your enemies"". The US-created ISIS gruesome murder of 20 innocent Christian civilians yesterday in the North East starts from this hate mongering by Saudi-sponsored Wahhabi clerics.Muslims and Christians lived peacefully in Northern Nigeria until the advent of the evil ideology of Wahhabism in the mid 70s. And this was when the hate mongering and demonization of Christians started in Nigeria.Muslims must understand that the closest religion to Islam is Christianity as only this two great religions celebrated the miraculous birth of Jesus (as) and the chastity of his blessed Mother, Mary (as).During the advent of Islam it was the Just Christian King of Ethiopia in Africa that gave asylum to persecuted Muslims. Prophet Muhammad (sa) sent dozens of his Companions to Ethiopia to escape Quraysh persecution. This historic act should be inculcated in the hearts of all young Muslims.Another dimension that need clarification is that we should stop equating Western hegemony, colonialism and imperialism with Christianity. The genocidal massacres of innocent Muslims civilians by the Western hegemonic barbarians should not be attributed to Christianity. Christianity is a religion and the Quran honorably addressed it people as ""The people of the Book"".Addendum:Killing of innocent and defenseless civilians stand condemned in Islam. Empathy, Mercy and Compassion are integral ingredients of the religion sent to Prophet Muhammad (sa) by God. In Islamic literatures, a woman saved a dog and God forgave all her sins. Just imagine the reward of those that save human lives? During the post election violence that was incited by President Buhari in 2011 who was in the opposition then, Sheikh Ibraheem Zakzaky saved dozens of Christian families from the murderous rampaging mob. This is the true Islam sent to Prophet Muhammad (sa).Unfortunately, the recent genocidal massacres of the Buhari regime, murderous terrorism by the Wahhabi infested BokoHaram terrorists, senseless killings by armed bandits in Northern Nigeria and the frequent killing of peaceful protesters by the Nigerian army and police totally negates the sacredness of human lives.On a final note, the Governor of Sokoto State should immediately fish out the murderous gang that burnt that student to death. Justice is needed here to serve as a deterrent for intending criminals. God rest the dead!Harun Elbinawielbinawi@yahoo.comElbinawi.","Dear Nigerian Muslims, Christians Are Not Your Enemies"

726,"Uli, in the Ihiala Zone of present-day Anambra State, played a strategic role during the most strenuous period of Igbo civilisation. While the Nigerian state aggressively pursued an “all is fair in war, and starvation is one of the weapons of war” policy, Uli Airstrip paid a glowing tribute to what we have always known about ourselves.Many historians agree that 1967-1970 would have had even more tragic consequences had it not been for the sacrifices that were made to protect and keep Uli Airstrip in a serviceable condition.Because major airfields in Biafra were captured by forces loyal to the government of Nigeria early in the war, Uli Airstrip became the most important link between the “dot in a circle” and the outside world. When Nigeria instituted a total blockade of the region, pilots have to attempt very dangerous night landing manoeuvres to avoid Nigerian forces shooting their planes out of the sky.There exist graphic details of how runway lights, for instance, will be turned on and off at specific times. Beyond the human causalities of protecting that important airfield, it took a great deal of engineering artistry, synchronicity and evasive manoeuvres to land planes there.With the tactical manoeuvres that accompanied each successful landing at the Uli Airstrip, Ihiala became another symbol of Igbo ingenuity, tenacity and drive. Sadly, modern-day “freedom fighters” have reduced Ihiala to a theatre of violence and mindless bloodletting.Who would have believed that people whose parents were saved from starvation would turn around to kill, kidnap and terrorise at the same spot where men and women, some foreigners, gave their lives so that hunger will not wipe off an entire nation?Whatever the excuses – and there should be a lot of them – we should, at the very least, publicly acknowledge that what is going on in the southeast today, which Ihiala has unfortunately become a major flashpoint, is not the best way to address the many injustices of the country called Nigeria.E reach for us to lament! The creative energies of some of our young people have been corrupted through the artful but manipulative use of words.The damage is far-reaching.It will take a while and a whole lot of effort before we recapture the hearts of our misled brethren and help them come back to the conclusion of our forefathers that Igbo advancement comes through witty inventions, tenacity, industry and shared values — not from victimhood mentality, rash emotional outbursts, hatred, hero-worship, unexamined ""truths"" and mindless destructions.Africa's morning will come.Chima Christian","Ihiala Should Be A Symbol Of Igbo Ingenuity, Not Theatre Of Mindless Destruction"

In 2020, he, out of frivolities led high standing personalities from Nsit ibom LGA on a ground sitting spree at the residence of AVM Idongesit Nkanga all in an aim to cause unnecesary heat up of the polity, and in this picture he was brazenly out of the scene while those he can  cajole, allowed their witty minds to be used in disgust including a Former Commissioner  in the State.This same sword with a double edge has collected 2 cars and millions of naira from a guber aspirant who he denied publicly but secretly went back to beg and dine with, also he's collecting over 500k monthly from another guber aspirant  with a promise of delivering votes and delegate he knows he has no power on except few of his concubines.

734,"2023: Emefiele may discard presidential ambition after meeting Buhari – Presidency sourcePresident Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday in Abuja met behind closed doors with the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele.The agenda of the meeting between the president and Emefiele could not be ascertained as at the time of filing this report.NAN, however, gathered that the CBN governor might have updated the president on the ongoing debate about his resignation or continued stay in office.The president had on Wednesday via a circular issued by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, directed members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) and other political appointees with political ambition to resign.Emefiele is among the heads of agency and extra-ministerial departments.Recall that when accosted by State House correspondents to talk on the outcome of his meeting with the president and the speculation over his alleged resignation, the CBN governor simply said:“I’m having fun at the scenario. Let them have heart attack. It’s good to have heart attack. I am having a lot of fun.’’However, NAN reliably learnt that Emefiele might have informed the president of his intention to continue in office as CBN governor instead of vying for the All Progressives Congress’ presidential ticket in 2023 general elections.The source, which preferred not to be named, told NAN that the CBN governor had finally decided to concentrate on his official job of safeguarding and transforming the nation’s economy.Some farmers associations in the country had raised N100 million to purchase APC Presidential Expression of Interest and Nomination forms for Emefiele, ahead of the party’s primary on May 31.https://dailypost.ng/2022/05/12/2023-emefiele-may-discard-presidential-ambition-after-meeting-buhari-presidency-source/",2023: Emefiele May Discard Presidential Ambition After Meeting Buhari
735,"Even people who normally pontificate with cocksure certainty about politics in Nigeria are mystified by what’s going on at APC right now. Everyone in the corridors of power that I’ve spoken to was either cagey or just as bewildered as the rest of us.But I came away with three distinct impressions from my conversations with different people.First, the current circus show of all-comers' gladiatorial presidential primary contest in APC has been orchestrated by APC chairman Abdullahi Adamu with the support of a faction of the Aso Rock cabal. He tells insentient Buhari to invite people to visit him in the Presidential Villa. During the visits, Buhari tells them to run for president and to meet with Abdullahi Adamu, who directs them to buy nomination forms.People Buhari has advised to run for president often assume that they’re his “anointed” candidates. But it's an Adamu-inspired scam.The truth is that Buhari doesn’t have an ""anointed"" candidate. His only concern is that whoever succeeds him should be someone who’ll conceal his iniquities, who’ll not probe the unprecedentedly stratospheric corruption his regime is perpetrating. He betrayed this fear, albeit in an indirect way, during his last interview with Channels TV.“Nobody should ask me to come and give any evidence in any court,” he said. “Otherwise, whoever it is, he will be in trouble because all important things are on record.” Buhari fears being asked to come back to give evidence in court for the corruption he is supervising now.So, he’s fine with anyone who won’t probe him.But what’s Abdullahi Adamu’s game plan for swarming the field of contest with an unwieldly large number of contestants? It looks to me like he designed it to edge out Bola Tinubu whom Buhari and the cabal both fear and despise.In a fair contest, Tinubu seems more likely than any other candidate in APC to emerge victorious in light of both his enormous war chest and his vast political network within the APC and beyond. But nobody in the upper reaches of APC’s hierarchy—Buhari, members of the Aso Rock cabal, Abdullahi Adamu, etc.—wants Tinubu to be the party’s nominee. That’s the one thing that unites them.You only need to study the 9 conditions that the party imposed on its aspirants to know that Tinubu is the target of elimination. The party said aspirants must sign a “voluntary letter of withdrawal,” and that this must be done before a “Commissioner for Oaths” or “a Notary Public” to make it legally binding.They must also sign an undertaking to accept whoever emerges as the party’s candidate and to never sue the party in the event that they’re aggrieved by the process that produced the nominee of the party.This seems to me to point to the possibility of the imposition of a “consensus candidate” for the party. The party chairman would most probably say that in light of the large number of contestants jostling for the presidential ticket (which he covertly engineered), the party would be bruised if it conducted either a direct or an indirect primary.  There is no unanimity among the cabal who the “consensus” candidate should be, but they’re united in wanting the candidate to come from the South South. Buhari and some members of the cabal are disposed to Rotimi Amaechi, Goodluck Jonathan, or Timipre Sylva.The family members of the late Samaila Funtua and other members of the cabal want Godwin Emefiele. So, even the cabal is factionalized.Nonetheless, the APC also fears that should Atiku Abubakar emerge as PDP’s nominee, they would lose the northern vote (and perhaps the election) if their own candidate is from the South-South. So, the party intentionally scheduled its convention to take place two days after PDP’s, and asked northerners like Senate President Ahmad Lawan and Jigawa State governor Badaru Abubakar to enter the field of play.If a northerner emerges as PDP’s candidate, Abdullahi Adamu will most likely impose a northern “consensus candidate” on APC. But if Wike were to win PDP’s primary election, Adamu would most probably choose a “consensus” candidate from either of Amaechi, Sylva, or Jonathan. I learned that Goodluck Jonathan wanted Adamu to assure him that he’d be the consensus candidate, but the uncertainties regarding the outcome of PDP’s primary contest prevented Adamu from doing so, which has caused Jonathan to pull back.I think, though, that Adamu is being a tad naïve here. Tinubu is the elephant in the room. The party ignores him at its own peril. If he loses out because of a “consensus” arrangement, he’d most certainly not take it lying down. He is a fierce, ruthless, unforgiving fighter.A consensus arrangement that gives the ticket to either a South-South or a northern politician might unite Southwest politicians to make common cause with Tinubu to frustrate APC in the region. Either PDP (if it makes the right choice) or a third party (if the PDP messes up) might benefit from this.https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10105892398358730&id=47904265",Kperogi: Making Sense Of Apc’s Allcomers’ Presidential Contest

739,"The Independent National Electoral Commission would continue to reject requests by political parties for the extension of deadline for the conduct of their primaries because it would contravene the timetable and schedule of activities for the general elections earlier released, the Resident Electoral Commissioner in Akwa Ibom State, Mike Igini, said on Wednesday.Using the 2023 elections as a reference point, the Akwa Ibom REC said the commission had given ample time to parties to conduct their primaries based on the timetable and schedule of activities for the 2023 elections.Igini who was responding to questions from journalists on why INEC was refusing the request of 18 political parties under the aegis of Inter-Party Advisory Council for changes in the electoral timetable and schedule of activities, maintained that the June 3 deadline was fixed and firm.He said the dates were arrived at based on the provisions of Sections 76, 116,132, 178 of the constitution as well as the provision of Section 28 of the 2022 Electoral Act.The chairman of IPAC, YabagiSani, had appealed to INEC, to extend deadline for conduct of primary elections.He had said that Sallah holiday, the forthcoming Ekiti and Osun States governorship elections and screening of an unprecedented large number of aspirants were issues that could hamper timely and strict compliance with the timetable.But Igini however wondered “why some parties chose almost the last few days to the end of the month of May for these all important activities when they know that submission deadline is June 3, 2022.”He lamented that within the broad outline of the timetable issued, parties have been making changes and sending letters almost everyday shifting dates, venues and time for the conduct of their primaries.The REC said, “As disruptive as these changes to our internal workings, they are free to do so and these shifts have all been accommodated by the commission to the extent that our staff now work and in the field during weekends.“They are at liberty to make these changes have been at huge cost to the commission that deployed staff to various states from Abuja and within states. By the time they arrive, they get messages of postponement even sometimes on the way to venues. All these have endured and accommodated within the framework of the electoral timetable published.“The only request the commission has difficulty in accommodating is in respect of fundamental shift of dates of submission of names of candidates that emerged from primaries and conventions as contained in the fixed and firm timetable and schedule of activities.“These dates are fixed and firmed as published and repeated severally in all interactions with political parties because they were arrived at based on the provisions of sections 76, 116,132, 178 of the constitution as well as the provision of section 28 of the 2022 Act. If I may observe and ask, why is it that political parties decided to leave out the whole of April that they should have commenced the conduct of primaries?“Why is that some of these parties chose almost the last few days to the end of the month of May for these all important activities when they know that submission deadline is 3rd of June 2022 ? Haven’t they been hearing and reading the Chairman’s consistent refrain of constitutional and statutory timelines are “fixed and firmed” at all stakeholders meetings?“Look, as I have said, changes of venues and time within the framework of already issued constitutional timetable by the commission, no problems and they have been doing that but a fundamental shift is what the commission has advised against to allow for certainty of timeline for the 2023 elections otherwise we will continue to shift and shift the timetable.”https://punchng.com/extension-of-primaries-deadline-not-possible-says-inec-commissioner/",Mike Igini: Extension Of Primaries Deadline Not Possible

Although, the Court of Appeal agreed the section was unconstitutional, it held that the Federal High Court, Umuahia, lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate on the suit.The appellate court further said the plaintiff, Nduka Edede, lacked the locus standi to have filed the case.Earlier, the Minister of State for Education, Emeke Nwajiuba, who is also running for president, also tendered his resignation.It is expected that other appointees of the president will resign following his directive.They are the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi; the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami; the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige; the Minister of Women Affairs, Paullen Tallen; the Minister of Petroleum Resources (State), Timipriye Sylva; and the Minister of Mines and Steel Development (State), Uche Ogar.https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/529176-2023-onu-akpabio-resign-to-focus-on-presidential-race.htmlLalasticlala","2023: Onu, Akpabio Resign To Focus On Presidential Race"

According to him, security and other developmental challenges in the country were persisting due to the failure to employ the best method.He said, “to solve a problem, you must go to the root cause, that is what I did in Lagos. You cannot do the job of today with yesterday’s forgotten attitude, we must develop new methods to redevelop our country.”“We have a great opportunity to change Nigeria and I guarantee you that we will change Nigeria, the change that made Lagos the richest state in Africa now is just beginning,” Tinubu said as he argued that Nigeria has no reason to be seen as a help-seeking country.According to the former senator and governor of Lagos state, with good investment in agriculture, Nigeria can produce the needed food in the country and still export twice a year. He said: “We have dams, we are yet to dredge them and bring irrigation system to the farmland to be able to farm and grow our own food, we have not even attempted it, why not.”“We have so many dams and so many abandoned projects, we should move away from seeking help to helping ourselves, we should help ourselves and liberate ourselves from hunger and poverty,” Tinubu added while stating that to develop and make the agricultural sector more lucrative the country needs the formation of a commodity exchange mechanism.“Commodity exchange is to guarantee to the farmers that there is a market for all the produce that is coming. It will guarantee the prices of beans, corn and other commodities produced and the establishment of a storage facility to stop waste. In the days of Awolowo, they had a marketing board, so you change it now to the commodity exchange and improve on it,” Tinubu said. He assured that his team is ready to face challenges in the country, as he said: “I am going to submit my form so that I can have a rest of mind and say at least you have gotten my application, I guarantee you that Nigeria will change, we will conquer banditry.Banditry and Boko haram are because we are not employing the best method, so I beg you at the coming delegates’ election to choose the president to choose wisely, choose me,” Tinubu appealed to the delegates in Gombe. He assured that the Gas sector is one area he would also develop to drive gains for the country.He said: “By now we should be making great money from Gas if we had planned it, Russia is threatening Europe and we are not the alternative market.”https://www.sunnewsonline.com/2023-tinubu-begs-for-votes-as-he-promises-to-make-nigeria-more-productive/",Tinubu Begs For Votes In Gombe As He Meets With Delegates

The attacks often target security agencies and government facilities.The latest development comes a few hours after gunmen invaded a military checkpoint in Agulu, Anaocha LGA of Anambra state on Saturday and opened fire on soldiers, killing one in the process.The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), an outlawed group, has been linked to the deadly attacks in the region.

755,"The All Progressives Congress is gradually proving to be as predictable as Nollywood movies, with everyone predicting the outcome from the start.I have since shouted about the conspiracy theory of Mai Buni alleged alliance with Goodluck Jonathan under the APC, should in case you missed it read here Egungun Don Enter Express: Mai Buni's Secret Ambition Boomerangs May End Jonathan's Presidency Under The APCPeople chastised me for making these forecasts, claiming that I was induced with high-grade narcotics to come up with such a theory. Permit me to repeat my previous forecasts from March 8, 2022 word for word.""Unfortunately, Bush Radio sources have it on good authority that Mai Buni had a different plan,  he wanted to become the Vice President to a Southern Presidential candidate and from the look of things his preferred choice of the Southern candidate was Ex-president Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.When we activated our GOAT EYES it was understood that there might indeed be a hatchet plan in drafting Goodluck Jonathan into the race by a certain cabal. Please do take note that Mai Buni was shopping for a Southern Christian presidential candidate.GEJ would be drafted in through the back door knowing quite well that he was not a member of the ruling APC.GEJ somehow has the trust of the Northern oligarchy and of course, he has only a single term to spend. So while Mai Buni sells GEJ well to the Northern Elites he was stylishly seeing himself as the greatest beneficiary.All these plans were in top gear even when there are hush talks here and there that GEJ may not be constitutionally eligible to contest for the presidency taking into cognizance he spent a total of 6 years as President.Now, this was the plan peradventure it sailed, there was never a plan to have a national convention instead it was meant to be a unity convention which translates to holding the NEC congress and Presidential convention on the same day.That same day the whole “abracadabra” would take place and the rest as they say would be history.""That strategy is still operational, but my concern now is why are presidential hopefuls like Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, Yemi Osinbajo, Chibuike Amaechi, and others remaining silent? On the eve of the form sale's deadline, GEJ carefully picked the APC presidential form through a proxy.The same night, GEJ met with Adamu, the APC national chairman, before departing for his customary international commitments.The outcry against the clause in the 'Letter of Voluntary Withdrawal' should be heard loud and clear. Why is the APC's case different from that of their PDP counterparts? Can this nonsense happen in the PDP without Wike or Atiku bringing the house down?Why aren't these presidential hopefuls kicking against this withdrawal clause after purchasing this form for N100 million and feverishly running around the country seeking delegates' approval? Does this imply that these hopefuls and the shadowy Cabal are on the same page?It's amusing, but given the time constraints and politicking, how is it conceivable that GEJ, who only joined the party yesterday, could garner enough delegates' support without presidential influence?""A leopard is chasing us, and do you ask me: 'is it a male or female?"" I giggle when I see Osinbajo's supporters still masturbating on Tinubu and their chances. Is Tinubu posing a threat to Amaechi or Fayemi? No there is a grand plan to shortchange the old leadership of the APC for complete strangers hence the intrusion of that ‘Letter of Voluntary Withdrawal,’It's awful if every political aspirant enters the primaries only to leave at the end of the day; we saw it during the last National Convention, and it's rearing its ugly head once more as the presidential primaries approach.I once asked why did the Presidency assure Tinubu of a fair play, promised Osinbajo the ticket and finally drafts in Jonathan to the race?  If they do not have a plan?That plan is now the source of my concern. If Osinbajo, Tinubu and the South  do not pull out and continue their regional resolution strategy , I will not be shocked if the game is rigged in favor of the North via the PDP.According to Babangida Aliyu, the former chairman of the PDP Northern Governors Forum during GEJ's reign, the North readily abandoned GEJ to collapse their structure for the APC, and he was also a victim, losing his senatorial district.This game that is being played should be avoided at all costs; it makes no sense for a single region to keep power for 16 years in a row. With a Jonathan candidacy , I'm curious to see how far the APC would go when the hate campaign begins.Buhari's videos finishing the GEJ's administration would be the National Anthem , these people don't know politics, they would manufacture all the ogogoro stories and bring in Patience back into the whole drama. You would soon start seeing doctored old videos of Patience insulting the Alamjiri's circulating like it was this morning it happened.The campaign would be strong and the same Buhari who is showing I don't care attitude would be preparing for retirement then, even if the PDP wins in the General elections it would bother him less.This message is not intended to stroke anyone's ego, but rather to serve as a wake-up call to our southern presidential candidates to wake up and smell the coffee, or at the very least put up a fight worthy of praise.My name is Osigwe Omo-Ikirodah, and I am the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Bush Radio Academy.https://ireporteronline.com.ng/blog/as-conspiracy-thickens-apc-southern-aspirants-keep-mute-over-letter-of-voluntary-withdrawal/","APC Southern Aspirants Keep Mute Over ""Letter Of Voluntary Withdrawal"""

764,"Over the years, the principal role of town planning authority is to develop quality urban designs and to ensure even development in all parts of Lagos metropolis.Essentially, the town planning department is a major catalyst in bringing out the beauty of Lagos. Therefore, they are more like pivotal development partners in every state; most especially, when it has to do with a critical sector like the construction industry. This is so due to the multiplier effects the industry has on the economy, including job creation.However, lots of developers in Lagos are currently complaining bitterly that they are facing multi facets frustrations under the administration of the Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Dr Idris Okanla Salako, citing unwholesome activities and corrupt practices allegedly going on in the department brazenly.In an interview with our reporter, a top developer who pleaded anonymity alleged that Salako has brazenly turned the critical department of town planning to only revenue making channels, while totally abandoning the due processes and the core objectives of why the critical department was created.The stakeholder said “Due to the understanding of the sector, under the government of former Governor Babatunde Fashola; the physical planning department was pre-occupied with its core objectives;. It had a friendly outlook and had a robust relationship with all critical partners and developers.“The relationship with major stakeholders under Ex-Governor Fashola was so solid in such a way that there used to be monthly stakeholders’ meeting and collection of data from developers with a view to ascertaining jobs creation and development.“Also, under Fashola regime, quality development was the order of the day in the physical planning, and it was emphasized as a core objective. This development mid-wifed Lagos State Building Control Agency, LASBCA and Lagos State Physical Planning Permit Authority, LASPPPA. These two agencies are saddled with the responsibility of ensuring quality control and uniform planning under Governor Fashola. The purpose of creating them was to speed up the approval processes of building permit.He added that to ensure efficiency, * the administration ordered the two main agencies to be working on Saturdays. The synergy was so cordial in such a way that both the agencies and the stskeoilders learnt a lot from each other. The sole purpose was to make sure Lagos becomes beautiful and be a model to other states.“When Fashola left in 2015 and the government of Akinwumi Ambode came on board, the template continued and tried to improving on what he met on ground.The top stakeholder lanented that under the present governernt of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Salako-led administration has made things go awry in the physical planning department as a result of sharp practices, nepotism and desperation to generate funds by all means.He said ” Under this administration, the man at the helm of affairs in the Lagos State Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban Development, Idris Salako, has made the town planning authority abandon its core purpure of establishment. To the amazement of we stakeholders, Salako has made the department to derail completely by introducing revenue as the core function of the ministry as against the main objectives of quality and development.According to him, lots of construction players are currently groaning under Salako-led administration because of the high degree of frustrations they are deliberately made to pass through so as to satisfy some selfish interests.He saidI “In order to be in good books of Governor Sanwo-Olu and to be seen as one with the highest in revenue collection, he placed officers on target, mostly unrealistic targets; so as to be boasting of being one of the highest in revenue commissioner. However, it has been revealed that the idea is a daytime fraud.“To perpetrate their acts, the module operandi is to ensure that offices are increased and charge discretionary fees Developers are charged high fees. If such developer can’t meet up in paying the fees, Salako would give room to negotiations. He would discount the fees. Even at that, the developer would soon part away with money. Failure to do so may backfire on the developer.“In order to generate income, the Commissioner would be sealing buildings indiscriminately, requesting for building permits. Even the developers that met up with the requirements were made to undergo series of frustrations by citing all forms of technicalities just to ensure they cough out money illegally,” he added.The expert also revealed how some workers of the ministry used to invade the sites of developers who failed to “cooperate”.“Like thugs, some workers would invade the construction sited in a Gestapo style, chased everybody out, and in some cases, arrested and dragged construction workers to court on ridiculous and trumpped-up charges.The purpose of thossy scenes is to instil fears in the minds of players in the construction industry,” he lamented.He greatly lamented that the key stakeholders in the construction industry in Lagos are currently finding it difficult to breathe under Salako-led team,; which, according to him has priotized mainly on personal income against the key objective of bringing out the beauty of Lagos State as the commercial capital of Nigeria.He also noted that the absymsal failure of Salako’s is one of the factors responsible for the frequent rate of building collapse in Lagos.Also speaking with our reporter, a staff of the ministry who does not want name to be mention because of the sensitive nature the matter said that they are told to lure the developers to pay money when the ministry actually know that they are not ready to grant you permit; and that money would never be refunded. He added that this is part of the strategies given to them to meet up with ‘revenue targets’“This gives credence to reason under his leadership why collapsed buildings, staff low moral, nepotism have become order of the day under the Ministry. Even we staff are groaning, they can’t wait for him to end his tenure. Stakeholders can’t bear the yokes anymore being that despite the 7-day issuance of obtaining permit remains more difficult than collecting oil well permit under the Federal Governmen.Lamenting further, the staff revealed that Salako would also ensure that third party consultants close to the ministry are used to package the documents of developers, noting that the motive is part of their endemic corrupt practices..“The people enjoying Salako are the players with the same corrupt mindset who are ready to compromise and grease his pocket. That is one of the reasons why building are collapsing across Lagos because the structures are in variance with the total violation of required architectural designs,” the staff added.As part of the duties of the media to investigate issues, the Infrastructurenews.ng has begun the audit of all defective buildings as they litter Lagos; and this will come out in our next publication.We are also calling on Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to critically revise and evaluate the matter and get a third party assessment to ensure that allegations of woeful performance would not crop up in his second term.(Modify) (Quote) (Report) (Share)",Revealed: How Idris Salako Is Using Corruption To Frustrate Lagos Developers

778,"Who Destroyed The Reward System In APC? Buhari, Jonathan and Emefiele In Perspective By Osigwe Omo-IkirodahWhen it's your turn, morality and principles fade away, and all that matters is what you've always wanted in life.-Osigwe Omo-Ikirodah That is the tragic fact of our life, and it explains why Nigeria may never get things right. I've recently come to believe that if you do your best and stay consistent in whatever you believe in, the future will be better than you thought.On a daily basis, I am insulted for my political beliefs on a variety of platforms, most notably WhatsApp, simply because a small number of respondents are selfish and only want to reason along their lines of thought, forgetting that life cannot be viewed from a single perspective.My people argue that they shouldn't watch the ""Masquerade Dance"" from one location. Many people will appreciate my opinions by the end of this month.Before I continue, let me clarify that for every insult I get by the naysayers, I receive approximately 20 calls each day praising my political stance, with some even sending me Gift Items that is worthy of celebrations. That is what motivates me and not the idle rants of the ignoramus.It is getting clearer that all of these political players are the same, and there was never a need to swear loyalty to any of them because, at the end of the day, they have their own plans, which are evidently not in sync with ours.Who destroyed the reward system in our political parties? What is going on with APC? What happened to Buhari?Let me say this: You keep fighting me because of Tinubu simply because Peter Obi is your preferred candidate. Mr. B makes fun of Team Fayemi since Tinubu is their favored candidate.Isn't this amusing? With the way things are going, Peter Obi may end up being Tinubu's campaign director, and vice versa, and these same people would then have to justify why they chose their hero to support a monster they previously despised alongside their foot soldiers.Everyone is yelling treachery here and there, but who is the true betrayer? In APC, where is the reward system? Is the APC the town's newest tax collector? What games are Buhari and Abdullahi Adamu, the current chairman, playing?Yesterday, Jonathan picked up his presidential form in magnificent and symbolic fashion, much like John the Baptist, who was a precursor for the Messiah. Miyetti Allah opted to play the part of John the Baptist and picked the presidential form worth 100 million Naira.The same people who demonized GEJ until his inglorious exit are now racing ahead of him? Where is our value system for Miyetti Allah members? No, they've tossed it out since it no longer serves their interests; where is the conscience of Jonathan, who was shamed by these same people he presently romances?Forget GEJ's media aide's denial; Jonathan is fully in the contest till the convention date; his denial is similar to Obasanjo's third-term agenda denial ; if it backfires, he will deny everything ab in·i·ti·o.Take a look at the CBN. The governor was audacious enough to take his participation in the 2023 presidential elections to the courts; he donated N100 million to the party, and the party collected. When did GEJ and Godwin Emefiele become members of the APC to begin the purchase of presidential forms?What values does Africa's largest political party instill in me as an individual, a businessman, a family man, and finally as a Nigerian?Today, we wonder why people skip fuel lines to acquire petrol, why people walk via the rear door to get admission for their children, why the police take bribes, and the list goes on and on.Why should a party sell a form for N100 million if it is not robbery and the party decides to sell to everyone, whether or not they are members of the party?Is the APC selling its membership at the price of those who have labored, suffered, and worked for the party? When Tinubu was building the APC in the South West, where were they? When Rotimi Amaechi was branded a traitor for selling the APC to the Niger Delta, where were they? When Akpabio was busy sponsoring the APC in Akwa Ibom State, where were they?But, now that the party has commercialized its electoral process and is willing to reward individuals who have never fought for the party's survival, what use is party commitment and political allegiance if Tinubu, Osinbajo, or Amaechi are waived aside tomorrow for a newcomer?The supporters would then be told to campaign actively for the party's pick. Isn't this a hilarious game? What happened to our morals and values? The 2023 general elections will mark a turning point in our history, as the Saints, Pretenders, and Villains have decided to unite in one Whasapp group and are confident in their own skin.With the direction the APC is going, the incentive system for loyalty, decorum, ethics, and morality has been burned, and these elections will be littered with contradictions, therefore I urge everyone to do their best in whatever capacity they find themselves.The problematic aspect is that if we look closely, we can see that the APC is degrading the political system of loyalty and values, which is bad because the party's conscience has been sold.How can I stay the same after seeing how the APC plans to destroy everything of the principles I've always held precious in my life?After all of the injustices perpetrated by the party, the victims would appeal to their supporters to continue on with their lives. It's pitiful, so there was probably never supposed to be a fight in the first place.All I can see left  is the enormous economic opportunity this election presents, since morality and conscience have been sacrificed on the altar of good administration.May God Bless the works of our hands  as we continue to discover new things each day.My name na Osigwe Omo-Ikirodah and I am the Principal /Chairman of Bush Radio Academy.https://ireporteronline.com.ng/blog/who-destroyed-the-reward-system-in-apc-buhari-jonathan-and-emefiele-in-perspective-by-osigwe-omo-ikirodah/","Who Destroyed The Reward System In APC?

779,"I recall the geriatric Igbo traded that was beaten and beheaded by a mob in Kano some years back.The killers (at least the main instigators) of the old woman) demanded to be tried before a Kano Sharia court. All charges will later be dropped and the killers set free.Before the charges were dropped, Buhari waded in and condemned not the killings but the mob taking the laws into their hands.Buhari held the position that indeed the old Igbo woman who had spent most of her life living in Kano was guilty of the accusation of blasphemy as claimed by the mob. How he arrived at that conclusion from his hide away in Aso Rock only him can say.The key to remember is that Buhari never condemned the killings but the manner at which the woman was killed. Buhari held the position of the mob that the woman did blaspheme the prophet of Islam and expressed his dissatisfaction that the mob took the laws into their own hands meaning that he subscribes to the punishment of executing does who blaspheme the prophet of Islam. His only grouse being that the woman ought to have been arraigned in a sharia court , convicted on charges of blaspheme and the due sentence of beheading or stoning to death carried out by the authorities saddled with such responsibilities .Buhari remains a Boko.

785,"There are indications that the ruling All Progressive Congress is still undecided on where it would zone its presidential ticket in the forthcoming general elections.This comes despite the commencement of the sale of nomination forms by the party and aspirants purchasing them.National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Abdullahi Adamu, confirmed it when he said no decision has been reached in the zone to produce its presidential candidate for the 2023 election yet.This also comes as the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) led by Prof. Ango Abdullahi, has initiated fresh moves to pressure the major political parties to throw their tickets open to all sections of the country, saying that the “power shift arrangement is already dead and buried.”Adamu told State House correspondent at the Presidential Villa, Abuja on Friday after presenting the Ekiti APC gubernatorial candidate, Abiodun Oyebanji, to President Muhammadu Buhari, that the decision on which part of the country should produce the ruling party candidate was beyond him.While stating that the APC was yet to decide, he maintained that “I am today privileged to be the chairman of the party. The party is greater than me. The party has not made a decision and I cannot preempt what the party decision will be.”Recall that the ruling party had swapped its national offices between North and South, leading to the emergence of Adamu from the North Central as the national chairman.Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State had said just before the last national convention of the party that even though the APC had not decided on zoning the presidential ticket, the swapping of national offices was an indication of where its presidential candidate would come from.Adamu also said the party does not regret the high cost of nomination forms for candidates seeking elective positions under the party.He asserted that the APC was keen to discourage parties that have no chance of winning elections to sponsor individuals to play the role of spoilers.According to him the cost also had to be exorbitant because of the need to raise sufficient funds to successfully prosecute coming elections.“On the issue of cost. Yeah, I’ve been listening, with rapt attention, to the hues and cries from our lovers and from our adversaries. We have no regrets whatsoever. We did some homework, we know what it takes to go through primaries, go through the presidential campaign, go through the election for the President. We know what it takes.“We also do know that there are citizens who are qualified to contests, but who are not serious contenders, who will just want to take anything cheaply by the roadside, and assert what they call their rights and create problems for our party.“We’re also aware that some parties that have no chance whatsoever to win the presidential election in Nigeria, will sponsor people into parties that have prospects for winning the election, to create problems for us, to divert our attention, whichever party is involved in that.“Over and above that, yes, we are the ruling party. Yes, we need to set examples in what we do, but I ask you, I don’t know which part of the country you come from, If God forbid, your traditional ruler dies today, contestants to that office will go for more than N100 million, it’s no news.“When I contested for the Senate, all I paid was just a token; N5 million, N10 million, including the expression. When my colleague wanted to be chairman of the party, in the days of Adams Oshimhole, it took him N500,000. Today, for me, just as an example, to contest the national chairman of our party, had to pay N20 million to contest.“Alright, and even the enormity of work that has to be done, and this work will be done with the money. We don’t want to continue going begging.“So, I want to say that we’re trying to mobilize sufficient funds to support our efforts to win the election. Some protests may be well-founded, I have no quarrel with that, but the propensity of this, that people just assume ‘it’s the ruling party, is a quick… in our democracy.“I will not quarrel with that, every one of us has the right to express himself, and I’m in full support of these obligations, but we wear the shoes for our party and we know where it pinches us the most one” he stated.On the alleged recalcitrance by some cabinet members to resign to enable them face their political ambition, Adamu wrote it off as a legal matter which he would not comment on for now.His words, “thank you very much for your question. Our luck on this end is that I happen to be a lawyer and the issue you are raising is in court right now. So, it would amount to subjudice for me to discuss it at all”.https://dailypost.ng/2022/04/29/2023-apc-still-undecided-over-zoning-for-presidential-ticket-abdullahi-adamu/?utm_term=Autofeed&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Facebook#Echobox=1651246088",2023: We Have Not Decided On Zonning - APC National Chairman 
786,"… Holds Strategic Meeting with NDLEA, Other StakeholdersLagos State First Lady, Dr. Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, has pledged to work with the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) and other critical stakeholders to reinvigorate the war against drug abuse, especially in schools and communities across the state.The First Lady made the pledge on Wednesday at a strategic meeting held in Lagos House, Ikeja, with the NDLEA and other critical stakeholders, including the Wife of the Deputy Governor, Mrs. Oluremi Hamzat, senior officials of the Ministries of Education, Health, Youths and Social Development, wives of Local Government Chairmen, Police Officers Wives Association (POWA), School Principals, Market Women and the Medical Director of the Federal Neuro-Psychiatric Hospital, Yaba, Dr. Gbenga Owoeye.According to her, drug addiction, especially among the youths, has become a worrisome menace in society that no one could longer pretend about its existence.In her words: “The earlier we begin to tackle the daunting challenge, the better for our youths, ourselves and the social health of our society. This strategic meeting is aimed at putting the menace of drug abuse and associated social vices on the front burner”.“We are truly and deeply concerned about the increase in the rate at which the younger ones are now getting addicted to illicit drugs, a development that brought about the need for all relevant stakeholders to embark on a campaign to fight the menace and enlighten victims on the dangers inherent in such lifestyle both now and in the future”, the First Lady said.Maintaining that the time was ripe for real action to tackle the war against drug abuse and not just mere rhetoric, Dr. Sanwo-Olu disclosed that a series of initiatives would be unveiled in the coming weeks to advance the fight against the menace in schools and in communities across the State.She said: “At the level of the Nigerian Governors' Wives Forum (NGWF), we are all concerned about this and we have resolved in our respective States to frontally confront the menace, looking at it from a holistic point of view”.“We have to be proactive and connect with the schools, the religious bodies, community leaders and associations and others to cascade the message to all segments and sectors of the State”, Mrs. Sanwo-Olu asserted.On his part, Commander of the NDLEA, Lagos State Command, Barr. Callys Alumona, commended the First Lady for convening the meeting of relevant stakeholders to advance the War Against Drug Abuse (WADA), noting that something urgent must be done to prevent Lagos from becoming a gateway for illicit and dangerous drugs, both within and outside Nigeria.  He also urged the First Lady to organise a training workshop for women in government who are mothers themselves, as well as political and social leaders, to enable them to have a better understanding of the consequences of drug abuse and the signs to note when a child is engaging in drug abuse or illicit dealing in drugs.https://twitter.com/Mr_JAGs/status/1524820800125259777?t=WRH8chXzxxzXaQBx4a8lFg&s=19","Lagos First Lady To Lead War Against Drug Abuse In Schools, Communities"

788,"The Presidency on Tuesday faulted claims by the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, that the National Boundaries Commission is corrupt.The government said instead of cooperating with the NBC in the boundary dispute between Imo and Rivers States, Wike frustrated every effort made by the commission to demarcate the boundary.The PUNCH reported that Wike had advised the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to beam his searchlight on the activities of the NBC, claiming that the organisation now personified corruption in Nigeria.The governor spoke at a thanksgiving service held at Paul’s Anglican Cathedral in Port Harcourt on Sunday over the victory of Rivers State at the Supreme Court in the oil well dispute between it and Imo State.“Unfortunately, the most corrupt national agency is the National Boundary Commission. Corruption is personified in NBC.“If Mr. President is fighting corruption, he should leave innocent individuals and go to these agencies where corruption is personified. I’ve never seen people who believe anything they do must be for money”, he said.But the DIrector-General of NBC (a parastatal of the Presidency), Adamu Adaji, who made the clarification during a press conference in Abuja said, despite the Supreme Court judgement on the disputed oil well between Imo and Rivers states, the commission would go ahead to delineate the physical boundary. He said, “We will continue to do our work. The ruling of the Supreme Court was on the disputed resources not on the physical boundary.“In a concerted effort to carry out its core mandates of intervening, determining, and dealing with boundary dispute, the NBC scheduled and held several meetings with the two states involved. We fixed a meeting in April 2020 for the two states but got a call from the Secretary to the Rivers State Boundary Commission few minutes to the commencement that they won’t come on the instruction of Wike.“It is unfortunate that Rivers State has reneged on several agreements with the commission and refused to participate both in screening and authentication of document exercise and other action including partaking in the physical fieldwork, but now turn around to accuse the commission of being corrupt.“We want to make it categorically clear that the NBC was never an interested party in the oil wells disputes between Imo and Rivers as it is not our mandate and so we never joined as a party in the suit between the states.“It is, therefore, very insensitive for anybody to accuse the commission of any collusive actions when she is not an interested party in the case.“We vehemently deny any act of corruption in its conduct in respect to the Imo/Rivers interstate boundary and any other one for that matter and we wish to further reassure all parties and stakeholders that we will continue to engage all and remain focused on the fulfillment of our mandate.“As far back as January 2003, a joint meeting of officials on the Imo/Rivers interstate boundary was held in Owerri to deliberate on the modalities of the demarcation but unfortunately both states were evidently not ready for the physical tracing and the provisional demarcation of the boundary.“The only success recorded was the decision on the relevant instruments for use on the boundary which were identified as: Aboh Toposheets 311, Aba Toposheets 32, Ahaoda Toposheets 320, Okigwe Toposheets 312, State creation Decree No. 14 of 1967, and State creation Decree No. 12 of 1976.“In its concerted efforts to carry out its core mandate of intervening, determining, and dealing with boundary disputes, the NBC again held another meeting in October 2011 at Port Harcourt to review the previous efforts and come up with a new strategy for the tracing and demarcation.“Based on the uncooperative actions previously displayed by the states and some other states, the National Boundary Commission resolved never again to allow the apathetic nature of the states to impede on the commission’s functions.“Consequently, the NBC resolved to pursue the agreements of the joint meeting of officials held in Abuja in March 2020 diligently. It was agreed at that meeting, that parties would meet on documents to be used and thereafter undertake sensitisation campaign preparatory to the scheduled fieldwork.“In its characteristic manner, Rivers State again reneged on the agreement and refused to participate both in the screening and authentication of documents exercise and other agreed actions including to partake in the physical fieldwork citing a pending court case on the issue of ownership of oil wells.“The commission categorically made it clear to the Rivers State government that the case in court bothered on the ownership of the oil wells and had absolutely nothing to do with the NBC’s assignment to determine the interstate boundary between Imo and Rivers states.“Having earlier resolved that the commission would no longer “wait on” states that do not wish to participate before doing that which is necessary for peace to reign, the NBC proceeded with the conduct of its work of the physical tracing and provisional demarcation of the Imo/Rivers boundary.”https://punchng.com/wike-frustrated-imo-rivers-boundary-dispute-reconciliatory-efforts-commission/?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1652211237-1Mynd44Lalasticlala",Wike Frustrated Imo-Rivers Boundary Dispute Reconciliatory Efforts - Commission

794,"Why Obinna Oriaku Stands Out As Abia Governor 2023— Uche NnabuiheToday many are jostling for the Governorship seat of Abia state, a number of them are eminently qualified with both capacity and requisite experience to turn around the fortunes of Abia that has been held down for years due to poor leadership recruitment process.Abia is blessed with the best human capital in the whole of south east as they pride with such names as Okonji Iweala , Aruma Oteh, U.K. Eke, Johnson Chukwu, Chidi Ajegbu and so many more.  Therefore, 2023 avails Abians the opportunity to wisely choose from the the numbers that are presenting themselves as solution bearers of Abia leadership problem. Today Mr Peter Obi, the former Governor of Anambra State has become a barometer for measuring the qualities expected of leaders we need to change the narrative for Abia State and Mr Obinna Oriaku fits.Mr Obinna Oriaku is a selfless leader just as his passion lead him to serve Abia for four years (pro bono)without being paid salary by the state as his former employers First bank paid him for the four years. His focus was on instilling financial discipline and sacrificial leadership in the state by drastically reducing the cost of governance which has been identified as major reason for poor infrastructure and general underdevelopment of Abia state He on assumption as economic adviser to the Governor he reduced the cost of attending monthly  FAAC meeting at Abuja from about N4.4m to N.9m then made up N1.6m for the Commissioner reduced to N.5m,  N1.4m for the Accountant General, reduced to N.4m and  N1.4m for the Permanent Secretary Finance reduced N.0m as he stopped the Permanent secretary from attending FAAC meeting since Abia was the only State that was sending three people to Abuja instead of statutory two( Commissioner & AG)This action earned him backlash as some of the affected people were related to those who believe that Abia state is theirs. Mr Obinna Oriaku even as a Commissioner who draws authority from the Governor, was able to dismantle some of the structures that encouraged fraud in government and introduced numerous reforms that aided the State to achieve the little Abians witnessed within the first tenure of Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu’s administration. The reforms were the Civil Service Reform, the Judiciary Reform, Procurement Reform, Open Governance Reform, Local Government Systems Reform, Salaries and Pension Automation and Centralisation/Integration, etc. It is very clear that these reforms contributed to the achievements of the administration between 2015 to 2019 understanding the recession and low receipts that characterised that era hence it is referred as the glorious era of Okezie Ikpeazu’s administration. All the major projects ranging from remodeling of Enyimba Stadium to the automated Shoe factory and major roads where done or initiated during that first tenure period and a lot was achieved even with the distraction of protracted litigations that lasted over three years.While we give credit to the Governor that gave Mr Obinna Oriaku the authority and opportunity to carry out these reforms, the following represents the areas he touched while serving as a Commissioner:1 Review of the  overhead of the State Exco allowance from N1m to N.5m.2 Review of Commissioners’ official cars from Prado of N18m to Hyundai IX 35 of N6.9m as at 2015.3  Review of the SSG overhead cost from N14m monthly to N7M monthly.4  Review of the 3% of monthly  JAAC allocation to seven  members of local government service commission from average  N30m to N6m.5 Review of salaries management of civil servants (automation,centralization and integration brought about a savings of about N600m monthly 6  Automation also identified and exposed ghost workers earning from different MDAs and those earning salaries as Special Advisers and Civil Servants at the same time. 7. Abolished the use of 19 sub treasuries that was a conduit for fraud and replaced it with automated pension payment which saved funds .8. Review of the wage bill of Permanent Secretaries and eliminated a so called security vote that blew-up the salary of Abia Permanent Secretaries to be the highest in South East and beyond.Today Abia workers remember when Mr. Oriaku was in the saddle as the “good old days”.  If the state then was struggling with an average receipt of  N2.9b monthly  and owed secondary school  teachers 5 months salary arrears etc, Why are they being owed 14 months today when current allocation averages N5.6b, yet the State’s monthly wage bill of secondary school teachers has been reduced from N470m to N200m following the disarticulation Mr Oriaku championed the reform which transferred the wage bill of JSS 1to 3 Teachers to the Local Government system. Abia Poly and ABSUTH  that were 7 months and 8 months respectively in those “good old days, have all gone up to 25 and 32 months respectively.We know today that over 79% of Abia State monthly receipts goes into recurrent expenditure that is an express route to perdition. ABIA is God’s own State and the solution to her rediscovery starts with the fear of God and financial discipline as seen in Anambra during Peter Obi.Mr Obinna Oriaku was able to implement the much he could under the leadership of the present Governor who takes the credit but it is regrettable that most of all those reforms which should have seen Abia grow were all abandoned when the owners of the state insisted that Mr. Oriaku will never be part of the administration.It is instructive to note that Mr Oriaku understands the problems of Abia better than other aspirants having worked deeper in Abia as change agent  . He is  the only person who has come out openly to  confront those who believe Abia belongs( personal estate )to them both while in and out of Government. Many stories were peddled about his stewardship especially in the negative from those who believe Abia belongs to them but to the glory of God, they have all tuned positive.  Today Abians are wiser and the God who called and sustains him knows that he remains the best choice for Abia State come 2023If he could achieve the little as a Commissioner working under a Governor, then entrust him with the entire responsibility and see God cause Abia State to blossom.",Why Obinna Oriaku Stands Out As Abia Governor 2023— Uche Nnabuihe
795,"PRESS RELEASEThe attention of our great party, the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) has been drawn to an utterly false and fictitious story making the rounds wherein the Supreme Court purportedly reviewed its judgment delivered on the 14th day of October, 2021 dismissing the appeal brought by one Chief Jude Okeke against the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Kano Division. In the said ludicrous story which has now gone viral on various social media platforms, the apex court was reported to have ‘coronated’ one Chief Edozie Njoku as the National Chairman of APGA.We wish to state that contrary to the wishful thinking of the naysayers, no such decision was delivered by the Supreme Court on the 9th day of May, 2022 or on any other date. It is on record that the Supreme Court in SC. 686/2021 merely held that the dispute over the National Chairmanship of APGA is not justiciable and is not within the jurisdiction of the Court. The apex court in making that statement merely mentioned Edozie Njoku as the name utilized by the Plaintiff in Birnin Kudu as the National Chairman of APGA who was purpotedly removed to pave way for Chief Jude Okeke. The Kano Division of the Court of Appeal, whose judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court, clearly stated that the Jigawa High Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit and thus set aside the Birnin Kudu judgment alongside the consequential orders made therein.We wish to categorically state that by holding that the trial Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the suit ab initio, the Supreme Court could not have made any positive orders to enure in favour of Chief Edozie Njoku or any other person whatsoever.It’s on record that the Supreme Court in delivering its judgment aforesaid similarly dismissed the appeal brought by Chief Edozie Njoku against the ruling of the Kano Division of the Court of Appeal which dismissed his application to appeal as an interested party. It therefore beats any reasonable imagination how the Supreme Court would turn around to overrule itself after dismissing the grossly incompetent appeal filed by Edozie Njoku.A careful perusal of the document presently bandied by Chief Edozie Njoku and his hirelings readily reveals that the judgment was against the said Chief Edozie Njoku whose media urchins are polluting the space with the fake news. The Supreme Court not only struck out the appeal as an abuse of Court process but awarded 1m naira cost against the Appellants.Furthermore, the certified true copy of the Supreme Court judgment shows that Chief Victor Oye was the 2nd Respondent at the Supreme Court and was duly represented by Chief Wole Olanipekun SAN, Dr Onyechi Ikpeazu SAN, PIN Ikwueto SAN alongside others. However, in a poorly scripted fraudulent attempt to mislead the public, Chief Edozie Njoku’s name was inserted in the doctored judgment as the 2nd Respondent when Chief Edozie Njoku was not a party in the appeal at the Supreme Court. In any event, there are subsisting judgments of various superior courts of records that have made definite pronouncements on APGA leadership by affirming the May 31, 2019 National Convention of APGA held in Awka, Anambra State.We wish to assure our party faithful and indeed the members of the public that there is no purported change whatsoever in the leadership of APGA. Ozonkpu Dr Victor Ike Oye remains the National Chairman of APGA and has not been removed by any court. The general public are therefore advised to ignore the false, fictitious and misleading story being peddled by the agents of distraction. Our great party is solely focused in the process of nomination of credible candidates that will deliver our country from its present state of underdevelopment.Our great party has alerted the relevant security agencies to commence investigation towards the possible prosecution of those who may be found culpable in the forgery and mutilation of vital court judgments.Ezeokenwa Sly Jr EsqNational Legal Adviser, APGAhttps://apga.org.ng/2022/05/supreme-court-never-sat-let-alone-sack-me-as-apga-chairman-victor-oye/","Victor Oye: Supreme Court Never Sat, Let Alone Sack Me As APGA Chairman"
796,"  I'm just loving how things are currently unfolding in Nigerian politics. Who would've thought the crazy old man who with his gullible agbero followers, and their then fulani allies, humiliated GEJ outta power.... Thereby removing the feeding bottle from our mouths  Thiefnubu and his gullible followers are the reason why power remained with us for only 4 years instead of a complete 8, and that is unacceptable and unforgivable to us from the south south. Thiefnubu can NEVER EVER be president of the federal republic of Nigeria. I've not really been following Nigerias politics for a while now because I've been on foreign affairs exposing the hypocrisy, double standards and lies of the West.Meanwhile, the current rumors apparently made me so happy and I ran back to get myself updated because tbh nothing feels better than knowing that the murthafuckers who contributed to your downfall will soon experience theirs.Bros J will join APC and get the ticket ahead of Thiefnubu who thinks he's an important person in the party.Ps: I prefer PDP to APC. But PDP does not really have any competent candidate that can give Thiefnubu a clean and sound defeat. if nothing is done, APC with the incompetent Thiefnubu who is without any doubt, worse than buhari would win the 2023 election. To avoid that, GEJ ramming Thiefnubu to the side, getting the ticket, and winning with APC is actually alot better.After 4 years of his rule, we'll hand over to fulanis again.",Payback Time For Bola Tinubu?

I drove a Permanent Secretary to an important, urgent function in fact, to a luncheon at the Vic'In the same vein,  I joined the Ikorodu Branch of the NBA to do our own share of building the nation.

I was privileged to witness their press conference, I interacted with the executives of the branch and the branch Fida executives. I also participated in their road walk against domestic violence. The placards used during the road walk which read 'NBA say no to drug abuse, NBA say no to Pornography, NBA say no to Domestic Child Labour' etc were used to drive the messages home as we walked round the streets of Ikorodu. Lawyers are indeed true nation builders; their contributions to nation building through their services to the nation are unequalled. This is underscored in the following words of Fred Rodell; 'It is the lawyers who run our civilization for us — our governments, our business, our private lives. Most legislators are lawyers; they make our laws. Most presidents, governors, commissioners, along with their advisers and brain-trusters are lawyers; they administer our laws. All the judges are lawyers; they interpret and enforce our laws. There is no separation of powers where the lawyers are concerned. There is only a concentration of all government power — in the lawyers.'I am grateful to the Adimbola Ojedokun led executive of the branch of NBA and the Chairman of the law week committee Rotimi Ogunleye and a host of other members of the branch who turned out enmass to join in the branch week long activities of building the nation.",Lawyers Are True Nation Builders- Maximus Ugwuoke Commends NBA Ikorodu Branch

805," Governor Chukwuma Soludo of Anambra State has said that political agitations in the Southeast have turned into a criminal enterprise in which the perpetrators have taken the zone hostage and disrupted the economic life of the people.Speaking on Wednesday in Lagos during an event by the Anambra State Security Trust Fund, the governor said his administration would do everything possible to take the state back from the hoodlums and return it to the people of the state.He said that the agitators constituted themselves into a quasi-government, set up roadblocks, collected taxes, tolls and levies from the people and terrorized the people of the state.He added that kidnapping for ransom, murder, idolatry, and other forms of criminality became a criminal enterprise with those involved making huge sums of money at the expense of the people of the state.He told the gathering, who were “who is who” from Anambra State residents in Lagos, that it is the responsibility of the government and people of the state to rescue it from the non-state actors who wanted to overwhelm the people.Soludo stated that it was imperative that the people take the state from the hoodlums and make their homeland livable and prosperous, adding, “Your hosts will not respect you if you do not have a prosperous and livable home.”He stated that it was in the bid to curb insecurity and other challenges that the state set up the Anambra State Security Trust Fund and called on individuals, corporate entities and organizations to contribute to the fund. The governor outlined strategies the state has put in place to reverse the situation and called on the people to donate to the fund, adding that the state could not do it alone.According to Soludo, the budget of the state is less than two per cent of the Gross Domestic Product of the state, meaning that over 98 per cent of the resources in the state are in private hands.He also outlined strategies to resolve challenges in the education, health, power, infrastructure and other sectors in the state.Also speaking at the event, Air Vice Marshall Chiobi (Retd), special adviser to the governor on security, said that the state has adopted a technology-driven strategy to curb insecurity, adding that the state needs equipment like armoured personnel carriers, computers, vehicles and others to curb crime and reduce insecurity.https://independent.ng/agitations-in-southeast-now-criminal-enterprise-soludo/",Agitations In Southeast Now Criminal Enterprise – Soludo

We are seeing them distributing luxury cars and buying aspiration forms of millions.Every year there is  Budget of renovating every office in villa and National assembly, even thier furnitures and decorations, allowances for servicing their vehicles and weekly newspaper which are all frivolous & greedy expenditure considering the country situation, huge amount of money are earmarked for these, if these money could be diverted to Education sector it would be a great achievement. Education and these frivolous office renovation which one supposed to forfeit it's own share ?We have to think rational please.Yes ! Strike is not the only option to solve this issue, students should also storm Abuja and block every road in a bid to pressure the govt to act urgently, this will surely yield better fruits as it is the only language Nigerian govt understands !We still have some blockhead writers that have absurd audacity to support govt in trying to destroy education system by advising them to eliminate ASUU...Be rest assured, if ASUU is dissolved today, education system will not last for decade, even if it does, poor people can no longer afford it as it will be very expensive and that is what Govt want.

Igboayaka and that of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Prof. George Obiozor.Ohanaeze Youth Council (OYC), the youth wing of the Southeast apex socio-cultural group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, has accused Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi of funding terrorism in the Southeast region. The Council advised Governor Umahi to desist from sponsoring terrorism in the region.The Council made the accusation in reaction to Umahi’s allegations against the national president of OYC, Igboayaka O. Igboayaka and that of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Prof. George Obiozor. Governor Umahi’s Aide, Chief Onyekachi Nwebonyi, had on May 10 described Igboayaka’s opposition against the governor as an outpouring of anger over Umahi's refusal to grant the OYC National President’s financial request.According to Nwebonyi, Igboayaka had approached Umahi for funds to mobilise Igbo youths and also reach out to youths in other zones in Nigeria to support the governor’s presidential bid. ""Igboayaka's imagined allegations against Umahi are obviously a result of his failure to scam Umahi. He became livid with anger when Governor Umahi who claimed he had no money to mobilise youths across the country through him, bought APC N100m nomination and interest forms. The allegations of insecurity against Umahi by Igboayaka is just concocted to curry attention and nothing more, as insecurity has become an issue of concern in the South East,"" OYC quoted Nwebonyi as saying.But reacting to Nwebonyi’s allegations in a press statement made available to journalists, the OYC National President denied ever making such a request from the governor, saying he had never in his life had any physical contact with Governor Umahi let alone made any financial demand from him.Igboayaka challenged Nwebonyi to present evidence of the Council’s fund request from Umahi.""I have never met Governor David Umahi before, and neither have I ever engaged in any formal nor informal conversation or meeting pertaining to Governor Umahi's presidential ambition. Therefore, I challenge Chief Onyekachi Nwebonyi to present to the general public the said letter of funding by Ohanaeze Youth Council.”Igboayaka stated that he only had a chat with Umahi on the rising insecurity in the Southeast but the governor’s reply convinced him that he (Umahi) was playing a role in the security challenge in the region.""I recall that I only chatted with Governor Umahi about insecurity in the Southeast which he bluffed me. I still have his reply with me, and his reply to me convinced me that Umahi has a role in insecurity in Southeast,"" Igboayaka stated.The Youth Council President stated that Umahi and his political cohorts in Imo State failed woefully to use insecurity as a tool to undermine the administration of Senator Hope Uzodinma. ""This is a result of Governor Umahi's perception that Senator Hope Uzodinma might vie for President in 2023.”He said, ""Governor Umahi and his political vampires in Imo had plotted to use his 'Militant Killers Boys' to run Imo State down, but he couldn't succeed. It's obvious that with the primitivism of some Ebonyian youths whom he kept jobless, it's very easy to mobilise them to take up arms as a means of survival. This monster he created will consume him.”Igboayaka alleged that Governor Umahi's desperation for presidency prompted him to send billions of money to Borno State and therefore called on Ebonyians to demand that the governor returns billions of naira he sent to Borno.""It's obvious that Governor Umahi's outburst towards Prof. George Obiozor on Channels TV, stating that Prof. George Obiozor is slow on the release of Nnamdi Kanu is a deliberate attempt to incite Indigenous People Of Biafra (IPOB) against the president-general of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, and to use the medium to send his 'Militant Killer Boys' to raze down the remaining part of Prof. Obiozor's house, all to finish his evil enterprise in order to blackmail IPOB before the general public.""Governor David Umahi is a desperate wicked politician, if not, such a man can't come in public to make a caricature of Prof. Obiozor over such a sensitive matter,"" he stated.He further described Umahi as an 'inhumane fellow', saying that ""Umahi's alleged involvement in Effium and Ezza community war alongside his 'Militants Killer Boys' has left many youths in that area dead. I challenge people to go to Effium and Ezza to make private findings so as to ascertain if I am lying.”He revealed that in their confidential findings, “Governor Umahi has seen that he can't be trusted with Nigeria's number one position, therefore, he is now wasting the state fund of Ndi-Ebonyi to lobby for vice president."" http://saharareporters.com/2022/05/11/stop-funding-terrorism-southeast-nigeria-ohanaeze-youths-lambast-ebonyi-governor-umahi",Ohanaeze Youth Council Accuse Umahi Of Funding Terrorism In The South East
814,"2023 and the Contentious Issue APC Must ConfrontFor the APC, the 2023 presidential elections present a real test of its ability to survive and forge a unified front as a political organisation. The Buhari era is about to end, and the hitherto unifying figure of a Buhari that appears to have glued the disparate tendencies in the party together will no longer be there. Already, the commencement of the process of picking the party’s candidate for the 2023 contest has shown glaringly that the contest will be brutal and acidic, unless a miracle happens. Since the party’s initial objective of booting out PDP and gaining power has been achieved in the Buhari two-term presidency, 2023 will signal for the party the real wheeling and dealing of ruthless ambition driven by self-aggrandizement among its contending power blocs. Even now, allegations of betrayal, vociferous proclamation of personal ambitions and dirty innuendoes about imposition of candidates have started reaching an uncomfortable level in the party. Regardless of the drama and subplots that have started unfolding, it is for the party and Nigerians generally to zero in on a candidate that has the right mix of persona, charisma, vision, discipline, awareness and courage to keep the party and the country in good shape post 2023.The task may be daunting but what the party needs to do is clear cut. This is because the problems a post Buhari president will confront are already here with us now.One, with continuous fall in oil prices and a general lull in business activity since the outbreak of COVID-19, the economic realities have been worsened by the growing poverty and unemployment which has made upward social mobility unachievable for the wider population. The Nigeria Bureau of Statistics has continued to record staggering inflation rates, with food inflation and general cost of living growing out of hand and, according to the World Poverty Clock, nearly half of the Nigerian population currently subsist in extreme poverty. In fact, the Brookings Institute has predicted the figure to rise to 110 million by 2030. Two, the generality of Nigerian citizens are disillusioned that the current administration has not succeeded in its efforts to deliver democratic economic gains, better governance, and to tackle corruption and insecurity decisively. Thus, loss of confidence in the government and the party is very high.The initial public upbeat mood that greeted government’s fight against corruption at incipient following the introduction of revolutionary measures such as the Treasury Single Account (TSA) to reduce leakages has, sadly, evaporated today, leading to growing frustration. Three, more than ever before, Nigeria is looking incapable of taming the intractable insecurity situation in the land as citizens shiver due to increased attacks from bandits, kidnappers and terrorist groups. Kidnappings have reached a crisis point with increased scale and frequency. Call for balkanization of the country along ethnic lines has also been gaining traction.Arising from the growing citizen frustration, it is clear that whoever the party chooses to replace President Buhari in 2023 must have the dexterity, knowledge and empathy required to manage the potentially game-changing citizen advocacy led by a historically apathetic middle class that has woken up to bark and bite. This awakened group will definitely offer a more coordinated and sophisticated challenge to the status quo than Nigeria has ever had to manage before. Of course, because social media and digital have also come to offer more ammunition for the citizens in their growing anti-establishment consciousness, it cannot be business as usual and the party cannot afford not to take into consideration these new paradigms and dynamics as it prepares for life in government after Buhari. The challenge therefrom is that from its array of political gladiators that have indicated interest in the job, APC has to pick the one that most fits the profile of a 21st Century public administrator and politically astute servant-leader. Although, it is a tough call, the party’s best materials for now appear to be Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Senator Ibikunle Amosun and Governor Kayode Fayemi. In terms of finesse, experience, capability, age and ability to cross-connect the various critical population segments, the three stand out from the pack. If APC is to respect and espouse the principles of fairness, equity and national cohesion by fielding a Southern candidate after President Buhari’s eight years, any of the three stand a chance of recreating and shoring up the party’s brand fortune.However, it is an open secret in political circles across the South West that, unlike the Vice President and the Ekiti State governor who have been described by informed political watchers as tacit fall back options for the vaunted Ashiwaju Bola Tinubu ambition that appears to be hitting a political brick wall, Senator Amosun offers the party more gravitas and believability, especially among the segment of the population who still hold on to the notion that APC was created as a political vehicle to advance the personal ambition of the founding fathers and not to move Nigeria forward genuinely.   This is because out of the three gentlemen, it is only Amosun that is regarded as a true politician with a mind of his own and not a creation and/or disciple of the Tinubu School of Politics. Political watchers point at the fact that no one has been able to stick the disloyal, betrayer, Judas Iscariot and ingratitude labels on Amosun as done by the BAT crowd on the other two as a justification of the respect and political sagacity which the former Ogun State governor parades in the South west political space.",2023 And The Contentious Issue APC Must Confront

820,"…country loses N180bn from collapse yearlyNigerian paper mills have collapsed years after privatisation, forcing the economy to depend on imported paper for its needs.According to data from the National Bureau of Statistics data, Nigeria imported paper and its allied products worth N296.696bn between July and December 2021.While paper valued at N188.137bn was imported in the third quarter of 2021, import in the last quarter of the year was estimated at N108.559bn.A former Chairperson of the Pulp, Paper and Packaging Group of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria and Chief Executive Officer of FAE Limited, Mrs Layo  Bakare-Okeowo, told The PUNCH the local paper industry was dying and in need of urgent government intervention.She said, “We need to have a functional paper industry in Nigeria. Egypt has 25 paper mills but how can Nigeria with a bigger population have no functional paper industry.”Bakare-Okeowo said governments at various levels must provide the right enabling environment for the industry to operate.“This is a sector that has been abandoned. Let us forget about what has happened to paper mills and focus on the crisis in the paper sector. We want the government to save this sector by providing the enabling environment,” she noted. Nigeria once had three paper mills in the country: the Nigeria Paper Mill Limited located in Jebba, Kwara State; the Nigerian Newsprint Manufacturing Company Limited, Oku-Iboku, Akwa Ibom State; and Nigerian National Paper Manufacturing Company Limited in Ogun State.But the mills are no longer operating even at half of their capacities.The NNMC Limited, Oku-Ibokun, is said to have been taken over by the Asset Management Company of Nigeria.Jebba and Iwopin are struggling. Sources in the sector told The PUNCH that some of the investors who bought the paper mills from the government since the 2000s had been merely interested in importing papers while claiming to be producing them locally.“They also did not invest in them. Some of them also did asset stripping,” a source, who did not want his name mentioned, said.According to a former Director-General of the Raw Materials Research and Development Council, RMRDC, Peter Onwualu, and Director at RMRDC, Abimbola Ogunwusi, the inability of the three paper mills to work cost Nigeria about N180bn annually.They noted that the Nigeria Paper Mill, Jebba, produced 65,000 tons of kraft paper, liner and chipboards, sack kraft, fluting media and corrugated cartons per annum as of 1965.The Iwopin Pulp and Paper Company, on its part, was built to produce 68,000 tons of fine writing, printing and cultural papers.On the other hand, the Nigerian Newsprint Manufacturing Company’s newsprint mill had an installed capacity of 100,000 tons of newsprint per annum.However, they noted that the mills were unable to meet the targets due to the country’s lack of capacity to produce major inputs such as long fibres.Also, dependence on imported long fibre pulp and chemicals as well as epileptic energy supply were critical challenges in the industry.There are, however, new paper firms that are expanding investments. Dahua Paper Company is planning to invest $500m in tree plantation in Ogun State to enable it get raw materials for paper production. Another is Onward Paper Mill, which recently signed a recycling agreement with Tetra Pak. Bee Paper is also one of the new companies that have sprung up to replace unfunctional paper mills.The paper industry is a big business, and a number of firms, including newspaper companies, depend on paper for sustenance.Global paper and pulp market was $348.43bn in 2019, according to Statista, and this is expected to reach $679bn by 2027, but Nigeria is not in the party. Many players say the paper industry collapsed after privatisation in the 2000s as due diligence was not done before selling the paper mills’ assets.A researcher at Nasarawa State University, Zaccheaus Tunde Egbewole, suggested in his paper that “the only and urgent remedy is to put in place machinery for massive sustainable wood production.”He further said, “The use of indigenous wood species and agricultural residues should be encouraged for long fiber pulp production. Efforts should further be made for a stable power supply from the national grid to ensure the sustainability of industrial growth most especially in the pulp and paper industries.”https://punchng.com/nigerian-paper-mills-collapse-imports-hit-n297bn-in-six-months/","Nigerian Paper Mills Collapse, Imports Hit N297bn In Six Months"

APC is a democratic party. Today, APC is the ruling party at the national level. Today, APC is the ruling party in Kaduna State. So, for anybody to say this is what I want, due to whatever position such an individual occupies, and then deny more than three million eligible registered voters the right to vote, can’t be proper and acceptable. We don’t call that democracy.“Democracy is to come out and meet the basic requirements the party lays down and goes out to do. I can assure you in Kaduna State, there is nothing called anointment.“Everyone is willing and ready for a free and fair primary election and we believe the leadership of APC at the national level. We believe the capacity and the capability of President Muhammadu Buhari will not allow dictatorship of any individual,” he said.Former Deputy Governor of Kano State Abdullahi Tijjani Gwarzo, who submitted the forms on their behalf, hailed Ganduje over the choice of Gawuna, saying it was in tandem with the wishes of party stakeholders in Kano State.Flanked by the state Commissioner for Information, Mohammed Garba, the former deputy governor said Ganduje deserved the senatorial seat, having served Kano State meritoriously in the last seven years.","El-rufai’s Anointment Of Uba Sani Is Dictatorial, Says Shaaban"

These are issues that concerns us, which we are trying to deal with every day.”Speaking on security during his interaction with the delegates, the VP said the focus of the Buhari administration is to enhance local capacity on arms and ammunition production, adding that Nigeria must build on current challenges to develop a robust system that is able to tackle all of the challenges on scale.On sustaining positive growth in the economy, the VP said interventions that promote youth employment will be prioritized, especially the provision of necessary infrastructure. In agriculture, he noted that if basic infrastructure is provided, farmers will record improvements in yield and improved living conditions for their families. He added that the Buhari administration has prioritised ramping up local fertiliser production to support the massive farming activities going on across the country. Regarding the power sector, he said changing the grid structure, decentralizing the distribution network and reviewing existing regulations are some of the decisions that are being considered to overhaul the power sector for better result. Similarly, in the education sector, the Vice President noted that leveraging technological innovation to improve teaching methods and curriculum will greatly impact the quality of education in the country.Later, while speaking to the media at the end of his interaction with delegates, the Vice President said his meeting with the APC delegates have been fruitful.“It is not enough to say, ‘support me’; I also want to get a sense of what they want and what they would like to see from a government and an incoming government. ""The interaction is usually quite an intensive one, where we have a back-and-forth, and questions are asked; I think it has been very fulfilling and satisfying,” he stated.Earlier, the Vice President, on arrival at the Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa International Airport, Bauchi, proceeded to the Emir’s Palace to pay a courtesy call on the Emir of Bauchi, HRH Dr. Rilwan Suleiman Adamu.Speaking at the Emir’s Palace, the Vice President buttressed the need to further unite the country, considering Nigeria’s diversity in religion and ethnicities. According to him, “we must treat everybody with fairness and justice.“I believe that this is one of the reasons why it is vital, even in putting ourselves forward for the position of President of Nigeria, to bear in mind that the unity of this country is one of the important things,” he added.Thanking the Emir for his hospitality, the VP recalled his 2019 visit to the State to flag off the Rural Electrification Project for Ningi/Warji Local Government Area of the state, and also commission the Shared Facility for soap and groundnut oil making clusters during the MSMEs Clinic in the State.The VP said, “our concerns as a government have always been how to ensure that the common man is given a fair chance to be employed, to have a decent living, which is why several of the projects that we are undertaking have been to better the lots of the common man. “But also, we have been concerned about young people, how we can improve, not just the quality of education of our young people, but the opportunities for young people to get jobs, to be employed and have a decent standard of living.”While praying for fruitful and successful deliberations for VP’s engagements, the Emir of Bauchi said, “we believe that power belongs to God and He gives power to who he wishes to give. “Your Excellency, we are not politicians and cannot participate in politics, but still, we advise wisely and prayerfully for whatever would be the success. If not (that I am an Emir), maybe I would have asked His Excellency to make me his campaign coordinator for Bauchi,” the Emir stated with a smile, while praying for fruitful deliberations for the VP.Similarly, a foremost Islamic scholar and cleric in the state, Tijaniyya leader, Sheik Dahiru Usman Bauchi, expressed his support for the Vice President yesterday, while the VP was in the State.“We are going to support you. I have been praying for you, and now that you are seeking this position, I will double it, and by the grace of God, it is also my wish that the next time you come here, it will be as President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,” the cleric stated.During his visit, the Vice President also paid his respects at the tomb of late Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, Nigeria’s first Prime Minister. There, he described the late Prime Minister as a role model “who always talks about the unity of this country, the unity of the faith, the unity of the different ethnic groups.”“I pray that his legacy, the legacy of peace, the legacy of unity, tolerance, humility and integrity, will continue and that people who aspire to the leadership of our country, those who aspire to lead, and also the young people, will learn from it,” he said.Senator Adamu Bulkachuwa from the State; former governor of Bauchi State, Mohammed Abdullahi Abubakar; and other dignitaries accompanied the Vice President on the visit.On return from Bauchi, the Vice President also met with APC delegates in the FCT, Abuja, last night, taking questions from them on several national and political issues.Laolu AkandeSenior Special Assistant to the President on Media & PublicityOffice of the Vice President11th May, 2022","We Will Focus More On Improving Security, Economy, Lives Of Common Man–Osinbajo"

831,"Secondus ‘didn’t pay party dues for four years’Suspended Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) National Chairman Prince Uche Secondus on Thursday faulted his suspension, saying that only the National Executive Committee (NEC) has the power to discipline him or any member of the National Working Committee (NWC).He said those who purportedly suspended him acted contrary to Article 59 (3) of the PDP Constitution, which is clear on the party’s disciplinary measures.But, defending the suspension, Rivers State PDP Chairman Ambassador Desmond Akawor said the party chairman was ousted because of his refusal to pay his dues in the last four years.Akawor, who spoke in Port Harcourt, said Secondus jeopardised his party membership, following his refusal to pay dues.He said Secondus worked against the interest of the party in the state by balkanising members of his Ward 5, including issuing a directive that the former Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Davies Ikanya, whose defection to PDP was considered a big harvest, should not be registered in his ward.He said: “On June 5th, I wrote a letter to all wards that they should furnish us with the names of the party members that are dead and party members that have not paid their dues including those that had defected for one reason or the other.“Among the wards that responded was Ward 5 in Andoni. And it clearly showed that he (Secondus) had not paid his dues for the past four years. It is an offence in our party.“For six consecutive months, if you have not paid your dues, your membership of the party is questionable. That issue was kept pending because we had to approach the national to present some of these issues.”Akawor added: “In his presence, intervention took place and he agreed on all the words that were put down only for him the following week to go globetrotting going from Niger to Ota to continue the course and saying that all that they had agreed was no longer possible.“In that case what do you do? He’s not ready to listen to the elders, of course, he is equally not ready to look at the constitution of the party. The members have no option than to go to court and that was the only option.“I mentioned that at the ward level they set up a committee inviting him to come and defend those allegations, which if he doesn’t he remains suspended.He said Secondus further kicked against the decision of the Southern governors that the next president should come from the South.Akawor said for deciding to run for a second term in office, Secondus was prepared to rock the boat and work against the collective interest of the South.He said: “The southern governors took a decision that the presidency should come from the South as an individual or a politician he should have known that it is now time to come home.“The position he is occupying is on behalf of the South, he didn’t go there as an Andoni  man. he went there because the chairmanship of the party was zoned to the south.“If southern governors have taken a decision that they desire the presidency to come from the South he should have known that there is no point trying to rock the boat by kicking and running for second term.”Secondus, in a statement by his media aide, Ike Abonyi, maintained that Article 59(3) of the PDP Constitution states clearly that only the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party can discipline the National Chairman or any other National officer of the party.”He urged members of the public and the media to be wary of agents who were out to distract the main opposition party from its focus of rescuing NigeriaLast week, the PDP Ward 5 in Ikuru town, Andoni, Rivers State suspended Secondus from the party.His suspension was announced by the Ward Chairman, Mr. George Christopher, at the party’s extraordinary meeting in Ikuru town. He said 11 of the 17 executive members endorsed the suspension.Christopher accused Secondus of not attracting development to the area, despite being in a strategic position.He added: ”The ward 5 executive of the PDP in Ikuru town on Aug. 31, discussed issues affecting the party.“The ward executive suspended Secondus after a duly constituted meeting convened by the Secretary on the instructions of the Chairman in accordance with the party’s constitution.”Also, former Chairman of Andoni local government and chairman of the ward disciplinary committee, Mr. Benson Alpheous, said Secondus was suspended for disobeying the party’s decision that he step down as national chairman.“Until further notice, Secondus remains suspended. For now, until you hear from us again, Secondus remain suspended.”A Rivers High Court had on Monday, Aug. 23 granted an interim order, restraining Secondus from parading himself as the national chairman and member of the PDP.Justice Okogbule Gbasam of the Degema Judicial Division, presiding over a vacation court in Port Harcourt, granted the order, pending the determination of the substantive suit.This made the party on Wednesday, Aug. 25 to adopt its Deputy National Chairman (South), Yemi Akinwonmi, as acting chairman.In another twist, another court of coordinate jurisdiction in Kebbi on Thursday, Aug. 26 restored the embattled national chairman to his position.However, on Aug. 27, another High Court in Cross River granted an interim order restraining Secondus from resuming office as national chairman.Edem Kooffreh, the presiding judge, gave the order on Friday, while ruling on a motion ex parte marked HC/240/2021, and filed by Enang Wani.The court barred Secondus from presiding over any meeting of the party until the motion is heard.https://thenationonlineng.net/secondus-didnt-pay-party-dues-for-four-years/",Desmond Akawor: Secondus Didn’t Pay Party Dues For Four Years

We will work with the state to reticulate them. We will do this to combat irrigation. Katsina has the resources to be an industrial hub, to be a centre for industrialisation and prosperity. ” he said.Tinubu urged the delegates to support him to win the party’s nomination at the end of the month and be elected president in February next year.“Anybody can contest. Not anybody has what it takes to be president. I have the vision, the passion, the capacity and the competence to deliver for the country,” he told the delegates.Praying for the continued success of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration, he promised to support the president, a citizen of the state.Governor Masari described Asíwájú Tinubu as a cosmopolitan leader, detribalised politician, bridge-builder and uncommon unifier who brought many diverse people into the public limelight by appointing them into his cabinet as governor of Lagos State notwithstanding their states of origin.The APC chairman in the state pledged the support of the delegates for Tinubu, saying having supported our son, President Buhari, to win the presidency in 2015 and 2019, “we will support you too for 2023. Former governor of Borno State, Senator Kashim Shettima, who joined Tinubu on the visit to Katsina, said he was backing the APC leader not for political convenience, but because of moral imperatives.He said Asiwaju Tinubu in the past created a political party, Action Congress, which he offered to former Vice President Atiku Abubakar to contest for presidency in 2007 when Atiku was harassed and hounded out of the Peoples Democratic Party.Shettima added: “Asiwaju did the same for Mallam Nuhu Ribadu in 2011.

841," AT NATIONAL PRODUCTIVITY DAY AWARDS, PRESIDENT BUHARI APPEALS TO ASUU TO CALL OFF STRIKEPresident Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday appealed to the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) to consider the plight of students and call off the ongoing strike. The President also urged students in Nigeria’s public tertiary institutions to exercise patience as the government strives to address the nagging issues in the nation’s university system within the ambit of the resources available. He made the appeal at the 19th National Productivity Day and the conferment of the National Productivity Order of Merit Award (NPOM) on 48 eminent Nigerians and organisations in both the public and private sectors, for their high productivity, hardwork and excellence. President Buhari recalled that he had earlier directed the Chief of Staff, Hon. Ministers of Labour and Employment, Education, Finance, Budget and National Planning to immediately bring all parties to the negotiation table to again critically look at the grey areas in the demands of ASUU and in fact all other University based labour unions. On the theme of this year’s celebration ‘‘Achieving Higher Productivity through Improved Education System,’’ the President pledged that the Federal Government would continue to do everything possible to uplift the standard of the educational system in the country, adding that his administration recognised that the future of any nation is contingent on the standard of its educational system. ‘‘Therefore, if we desire to transform Nigeria into a competitive, strong, vibrant, productive and sustainable economy, improving our educational system should be accorded the highest priority.’’ Highlighting notable achievements in the education sector including the drastic reduction of the number of out of school children from 10.1million in 2019 to 6.9 million in 2020, automatic employment for graduates of education, review of the retirement age of teachers from 60 to 65 years, among others, the President said more still needs to be done. ‘‘Quality educational system is good not just for the national economy; it is also good for the citizens. ‘‘Ignoring the productivity dimension of education would endanger the prosperity of future generations, with widespread repercussions for poverty and social exclusion.  ‘‘It will be difficult to improve our economic performance and overall productivity, without improving our educational system. ‘‘Government notes the emergency situation in our educational system with particular reference to the dearth of qualified and dedicated teachers to enhance the quality of teaching and learning at all levels of our educational system,’’ he said. To address these challenges, President Buhari said his administration has reviewed the retirement age of teachers from 60 to 65 years, while years of service have now been moved from 35 to 40 years to encourage more graduates to join the teaching profession. Similarly, the President said the government has also approved a special salary scale for teachers in Basic and Secondary schools including provisions for rural posting allowance, Science teachers allowance and peculiar allowance, while prioritising timely promotion and prompt payment of salaries. Furthermore, the President said the reintroduction of bursary award to education students in universities and Colleges of Education comes with assurance of automatic employment upon graduation as well as payment of stipends to Bachelor of Education students. Congratulating all the awardees for their various accomplishments and well deserved recognition, the President said they have been carefully selected from a multitude of competitors, saying ‘‘this award should spur you to greater heights.’’ The President commended the Chairman and members of the National Productivity Order of Merit Award Committee, including the management and staff of National Productivity Centre for a job well done, urging the recipients of the merit award and Nigerians to make productivity their watchword. In his remarks, the Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige said since the inception of the award in 1991, 382 individuals and 97 organisations have been honoured with the NPOM.  Dr Stella Adadevoh and Mr Babatunde Lawal, received posthumous awards at the 2019/2020 edition of the National Productivity Day. Dr Adadevoh, who died on August 19, 2014, was recognised for her outstanding performance in the fight against the spread of the Ebola virus in the country while Lawal, who until his death on November 6, 2020 served as Permanent Secretary in the Cabinet Affairs Office. Babatunde, an economist by training with bias in fiscal policy analysis, management and strategic planning, was commended for his ‘‘thoroughness and paying keen attention to every detail’’ during his tenure as permanent secretary in the Federal Civil Service.

You know, this is just typical of Omoyele Sowore. You have to understand, Omoyele Sowore is a blackmailer and I've said it before, if I'm lying he can take me to court. He has blackmailed me before. The man is a blackmailer, a liar, I mean he has one of the most evil minds in that country. He has blackmailed me before. He has told lies about me, almost ruined my life. I had to go to court in the United States. I lost weight, I looked like a patient that had end stage HIV/AIDS, because of the lies that he told about me. He almost ruined my life. This guy is a blackmailer and it's not just me, he's done it to several people. If you remember, in 2020 when the End SARS was on, he tried to hijack End SARS for his Revolution Now shenanigans and when it didn't work he came out and floated this story and said that those behind End SARS had collected bribes from the Buhari Administration. And we saw that that was not true. I challenged him then, I did a video, those who were at the forefront of End SARS they challenged him, ""Come up with your evidence"", you know, because he could not control it.Now you have to understand, he wants to run for president and then he has deluded himself into thinking that he has a chance, so obviously he is going to attack anybody that he believes or suspects wants to run. This is an absolute lie. Go back and look at the level of lies that this man has told against poor people, you know, myself, all kinds of people.  He said that Former President Jonathan was drunk and fell down and that's why he could not address the African Union, he said that Former President Jonathan travelled to the United Nations with a delegation of 600 people. Please, don't take my word for it, just assume I'm lying, just google all these things I'm telling you. He said that. . .he listed 5 different ailments that then First Lady Patience Jonathan had, he lied that Former President Jonathan gave out gold plated iPhones at his daughter's wedding, which were all lies. You know, he now put a photo and that photo was photshop, but Nigerians believed it. Those stories were part of what Nigerians believed and it made them  vote out Former President Jonathan, they brought in Muhammadu Buhari, look at the result, the man has ruined the country. It's this Omoyele Sowore! And Sowore came out and said that he did not have a hand in bringing Muhammadu Buhari. He went to a radio station in Ibadan and I'm going to play that video after this (I hope I can find it), where he now boasted that he brought Muhammadu Buhari into power, Muhammadu Buhari rode on his back.Look, I don't want to digress, if you read that story, he said a source. A source, a source, a source, he could not name anybody, because it is a complete tissue of lies! Former President Jonathan was as shocked as anybody about that story, because I was in touch with him. I mean, I was speaking with him on video calls. So the shock, I mean we were scrambling! First and foremost, we wanted to find out who those people were and then he is now coming. . .the Badaru, the Jigawa State governor himself, is he not running for president? Has he not bought an APC presidential nomination form? So just look at the lies that this young man is telling (I don't know if he is young, he is over 50 anyway).  The lies!I mean, when I think about what that man. . .how that man tried to ruin my life with lies (Reno is now showing a picture of Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, Sowore and a woman on the screen), working with Mallam Nasir El-Rufai and till today now I think the two of them have fallen apart because Nasir El-Rufai is also a notorious liar and so, can two work together unless they agree? So these terrible, terrible human beings. . .Nigerians should not forget what this man did in 2014/2015, how he brought this government into power with his propaganda and lies. They should not allow this man to repeat it. He is now bearing the fruit of his sins, he is now reaping what he sowed, because Muhammadu Buhari knows what he used him to do and that's why he just arrested him, jailed him and then put him in that country. But I don't want to go too far, it's a complete lie, it's a tissue of lies, Omoyele Sowore if I'm lying take me to court, you are a liar, you are a blackmailer, you have tried to blackmail me Reno Omokri, now you can take me to court, I will prove it there.

Analysts attach an overweight recommendation to a stock that they believe will outperform its sector in the near future.According to Reuters, the bank analysts said Nigeria's national oil company (NNPC) did not transfer any revenue to the government from January to March this year due to petrol subsidies and low oil production.The bank further added that it moved Nigeria out of the 'overweight' category due to its fiscal woes amid a worsening global risk backdrop that has raised market concerns despite a positive oil environment.On the other hand, JPMorgan replaced Nigeria in the list with Serbia and Uzbekistan in the 'overweight' category. According to Reuters, JPMorgan included Serbia in the category due to the country's high reserves and a fiscally cautious government. At the same time, Uzbekistan was added to the category due to the country's relatively low debt despite Russian exposure.The bank analysts also revealed that the Emerging Markets Bond Index Global Diversified (EMBIGD) index had dropped 16% this year, ""with most of the losses having come from rates"" and $4 billion in net outflows from emerging markets since mid-April.They noted that riskier sovereign yields were now 10.6%, the highest level since the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic in April 2020, reducing market access and increasing the risk of debt defaults.https://africa.businessinsider.com/local/markets/jp-morgan-has-removed-nigeria-from-its-list-of-emerging-market-recommendations-that/3pf29jf",JP Morgan Has Removed Nigeria From Its List Of Emerging Market

854,"As we all know, the senate has passed a bill allowing people to run as independent candidates but they must get 20% of electorates signatures from each state of the country.We also know that the indirect primaries which is an option adopted by parties over the years have never presented an acceptable candidate that is loved by electorates but it is always about the highest bidder with delegates who seldom mean well for Nigerians and Nigeria smiling to the banks and i strongly believe this coming primaries may likely go the same way.There is also no doubt that the most acceptable candidates by Nigerians according to several polls conducted have clearly shown  Peter Obi leading for PDP and Proffesor Osinbajo for APC but i strongly fear that the primaries may not produce them and GOD forbid we are left with the choice of picking one of the recurring terrible options that may likely be presented by both parties after the primaries.If we consider the narrative above, we may have to start looking at the likelihood of Professor osinbajo as well as Peter Obi towing the path of independent candidacy.Unfortunately it may be quite unrealistic for the two to merge together cos of the same religion which may not sit well with a country such as Nigeria with Islam and Christianity as two major religions.So they just might be left with picking the vice from the north and see how it goes.Who knows, we just might see a surprise twist in the general elections.Yes there is need for a strong political structure and Lots of money for an independent candidate to succeed but i strongly believe there are willing money bags and political supporters who will ensure that these two lovable candidates have the best outing.But then this is my opinion.

Osinbajo who is also seeking the presidential ticket of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC should resign to allow for a level playing field for all aspirants.The activist who had also declared his intention to succeed President Buhari in 2023, lauded the president for his action.He said, “It is good that @Mbuhari has asked his ministers contesting elections to resign, but it is also fair, ethical and I ask that Chief @ProfOsinbajo MUST resign as well so that there is a level playing field for all aspirants”.DAILY POST had reported that President Buhari on Wednesday asked all his ministers eyeing elective seats to tender their resignation and focus on their ambitions.The directive was handed to the affected cabinet members during the meeting of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) presided over by the President at the Presidential Villa, Abuja on Wednesday.The Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, confirmed it to State House correspondents at the end of the FEC meeting.https://dailypost.ng/2022/05/11/buharis-order-osinbajo-asked-to-resign/",Buhari’s Order: Sowore Asks Osinbajo To Resign
857,"Following the reports, Jonathan rejected the presidential form of the ruling APC purchased for him on Monday, purportedly by a group of supporters from the northern region.There have been reports that a coalition of northern socio-cultural groups, basically of Fulani extraction, purchased N100 million nomination and expression of interest forms of the ruling party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), for former President Goodluck Jonathan to contest for President again in 2023.Following the reports, Jonathan rejected the presidential form of the ruling APC purchased for him on Monday, purportedly by a group of supporters from the northern region.Speaking through his Media Adviser, Ikechukwu Eze, the former president said it was an insult for the group to have bought him the forms without his permission.However, sources told SaharaReporters on Tuesday that claims by the former President that he did not authorise the purchase of the multi-million-naira forms are far from the truth.“Contrary to his denials, former President Goodluck Jonathan gave over N200 million to the governor of Jigawa, Mohammed Badaru, to purchase the APC nomination and expression of interest forms for him,” a source privy to the arrangement told SaharaReporters.Interestingly, the Jigawa governor, Badaru last week joined other interested presidential aspirants to vie for the ticket of the APC by buying the N100 million nomination and expression of interest forms.“I will join the Presidential race since everyone knows I’m a highly qualified person to do the job,” Badaru was quoted as saying during an APC stakeholders’ meeting held at Government House in Dutse last Tuesday.The governor was also said to have told the gathering during the meeting that he was pressurised by his colleagues to contest for the presidential seat.His media aide, Auwalu Sankara, said his principal had sought President Muhammadu Buhari’s blessings before buying the forms.But SaharaReporters learnt that the Jigawa governor had bought the forms and come up with the statements as a ruse to deceive Nigerians; as he was indeed working for Jonathan.It was further learnt that Jonathan backed out of the plan and swiftly came up with the denial after the APC National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, had refused to guarantee that the former President would be the consensus candidate of the ruling party.Jonathan was Nigeria’s leader as a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which is now an opposition party.“The reason why he (Jonathan) gave him that much money – over N200 million – was that he asked the governor to buy himself a form too in order to cover up the deal,” the source said.“And upon purchasing the form, Jonathan alerted Buhari. Buhari told him to meet with the APC National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, but Adamu said he can’t guarantee him as a consensus candidate“At that point, GEJ (Goodluck Ebele Jonathan) started denying that he purchased the form,” another source said.SaharaReporters broke the story of how a cabal in the ruling APC had pushed for Jonathan to succeed Buhari, after being impressed by how the former President never openly criticised Buhari government despite its ineptitude and the insults the APC, as an opposition party, hurled at him (Jonathan) ahead of the 2015 presidential election.The fact that Jonathan cannot spend more than one term in office, if they can manage to get him there, is also not lost on the cabal. However, SaharaReporters has also reported how Jonathan was later called a betrayer by the cabal after he failed to fulfil some of the conditions given to him, including convincing some PDP governors to defect to the APC.http://saharareporters.com/2022/05/10/exclusive-how-jonathan-gave-jigawa-governor-badaru-over-n200million-sent-him-buy-apc","EXCLUSIVE: How Jonathan Gave Jigawa Governor, Badaru Over N200m,sent Him To Buy"

859," The Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria has asked Nigerians to prepare for the worst fuel crisis.To avoid this, the petrol marketers association asked the Federal Government to prevail on the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority to pay its members their outstanding bridging claims amounting to over N500 billion.The IPMAN chairman in Kano State, Bashir Danmalam, made the remarks while addressing a news conference in Kano State on Monday.He said the failure of the NMDPRA to pay the the bridging claims, otherwise known as transportation claims, had forced many of its members out of business as they couldn’t transport the commodity due to high cost of diesel.He lamented that non-payment of the claims by NMDPRA for over eight months had crippled the businesses of many of their members as they couldn’t transport the commodity even though it was available.“NMDPRA is responsible for the payment of bridging claims otherwise known as transportation claims“For failure of the NMDPRA to pay the outstanding claims for about nine months, many marketers cannot transport the product because their funds are not being paid. Despite the high price of diesel, they manage to supply the petroleum products nationwide.“The resurfacing of fuel queues in Abuja is just a tip of the iceberg with regard to the petroleum scarcity.“Out of 100 per cent, only five per cent of the marketers can supply the petroleum products because of the failure of NMDPRA to pay them.”He noted that after the amalgamation of DPR, PEF, and PPRA to NMDPRA, the agency had paid them only two times.Danmalam, therefore, called on the Federal Government to intervene before the situation degenerated into a serious fuel crisis and spread to other parts of the country.“As leaders, we have to come out to say the truth because our members are suffering from the failure of the agency to pay the fund. This Petroleum Equalisation Fund is our own money we contribute to each litre. This agency is doing more harm than good to us,” Danmalam said.He said Nigerians should not blame their members for the fuel scarcity but rather ascribe it to NMDPRA.“We are not agitating for a transportation fee increase, we are only clamouring for payment of our bridging claims that is over N500 billion,” he added.https://punchng.com/prepare-for-worst-fuel-scarcity-petrol-marketers-alert-nigerians/",Nigerians Should Prepare For The Worst Fuel Scarcity - Petrol Marketers

861,"The Federal Government says with the coming up of affordable world class health facilities, Nigeria will soon put an end to the over N500 billion being spent on medical tourism annually.The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed said this on Tuesday in Lagos at a media tour of Duchess International Hospital, a 100-bed state-of-the-art multi-specialist healthcare facility.The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the private sector-owned purpose-built hospital was constructed through the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), with financial support from the Bank of Industry (BoI).Speaking after a tour of the hospital, the minister said with more world class healthcare facilities like Duchess Hospital coming on stream, Nigeria is set become a destination for medical tourists.He said the country would soon welcome foreign patients and medical personnel on its shores rather than having its citizens travel yearly and spending more than N500 billion for medical tourism.“We as a country will also conserve our foreign reserves while earning foreign exchange, we will begin to reverse the brain drain in the health sector; create jobs and provide affordable and standard healthcare for our people.“Of course, facilities like Duchess International are veritable tools for job creation, in addition to attracting medical tourists from across the world.“Its a new dawn for the health sector and we are proud of what Duchess and other healthcare facilities are doing in bringing about this new dawn,’’ he saidMohammed noted that although, the facility was private-sector driven, the Federal Government provided the enabling environment and funding for its realisation.He recalled that in the wake of COVID-19, the CBN set up the N100 billion Healthcare Sector Intervention Fund, which was later expanded to N200 billion.He said the intervention fund was to provide credit support for the healthcare sector through long-term, low-cost financing.“You are also aware of the Federal Government’s Intervention in the Healthcare Sector through the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA).“The NSIA has invested a total of 22.5 million dollars in two diagnostic centres in Kano and Umuahia (5.5 million dollars each) and the NSIA-LUTH Cancer Centre in Lagos (11.5 million dollars). The NSIA is also committed to building a new quaternary hospital in Abuja.“The essence of these financial interventions and projects in the critical healthcare sector is to fast-track the evolvement of world class healthcare facilities like this Duchess International Hospital.“With what we have seen here today, Nigerians can now get access to affordable and world class treatment in whatever is ailing them in many areas.“This includes emergency medicine, women’s health, paediatric care, cardiovascular medicine, kidney dialysis, dental treatment, and eye care among others, ’’ he said.While conducting the minister and his team of journalists round the hospital facilities, Dr Tokunbo Shitta-bey, the Chief Executive Officer, said the hospital was aimed at delivering the highest standard of healthcare to Nigerians.He said the hospital would use the most advanced technology, personnel and treatments to provide Nigerians with the best medical expertise available anywhere in the world.Shitta-bey emphasised that the guiding philosophy of the health facility was to cut down medical tourism in affordable manner with the same equipment and personnel found in the most advanced parts of the world.According to him, the facility is available for community service, patients in all strata of the society, offering wide range of specialised services and treatment.Justifying how affordable the hospital is, Shitta-bey said they charge only N5,000 for registration and consultation respectively.NAN reports that the six-storey hospital complex comprises of 16 Departments including the Cardiology Centre, physiotherapy room, ENT, Surgical and Gynecology Ward, Medical laboratories and Intensive and Critical care unit which are fully automated and equipped with modern equipment.It also has the Endoscopy unit, Women and Children ward, Dialysis Centre, Dental Unit, Surgical Theatre (Modular and automated) and PharmacyOthers are Emergency wards, Radiology Department, Play area for children and Learning and development Centre.

862,"By Esther Daniels The People's Democratic Party (PDP), Benue State chapter, has said the ""campaign of calumny"" being orchestrated against the party and its Tiv consensus Governorship candidate, Rt. Hon. Titus Tyoapine Uba, by the All Progressives Congress (APC), shows that the opposition was afraid of defeat in 2023. The PDP in a statement issued by its State Publicity Secretary, Bemgba Iortyom, on Wednesday, said heavier defeat awaits Benue APC in 2023 than they suffered in 2019, stressing that the APC stooping to ""fabrication of fairytale and lies only reflect fear and outright panic going into the coming polls.The umbrella party urged APC to come to terms with the hard fact that the Benue electorate, in making choices in 2023, will not be fooled by smokescreens of lies and insults on opponents, but would be led to those choices by a combination of antecedents of candidates and track-record of political platforms sponsoring them.""In this light the latest round of allegations by APC that the N38 billion loan approved by the State Assembly for the administration of Governor Samuel Ortom when obtained will be used as campaign finances for the Speaker, is just another whiff in the opposition smokescreen of lies which the electorate will ignore.""Detailed clarifications already made by the Special Adviser to the Governor on Media, Hon. Terver Akase, shows that the N38bn so approved by the Assembly is the balance of an earlier N69bn loan request made by the administration to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in 2015, alongside other states, for purpose of offsetting inherited arrears of salaries and pensions to workers.""Out of that request which was tagged Bailout Loan, the sum of N28 billion was granted by CBN leaving a balance of N41 billion, which is the component covered by the latest approval granted by the State Assembly, for which purpose remains ab initio the offsetting of outstanding salaries and pensions to workers in the local and state tiers of government,"" it explained.The PDP continued: ""APC must also come to terms with the fact that the Benue electorate will appraise the debt profile of the Ortom administration against the highly visible backdrop of infrastructure projects and social amenities it has provided across the state in the face of crippling insecurity.""The people understand that with the shrunken monthly allocation from Federal coffers, the administration has been constrained largely to rely on borrowing to meet its obligations, same way it has been with other states and as well the 'almighty' federal government.""They are also well aware that while other states have enjoyed preferential support from the federal government in the forms of grants and interventions all along, Benue has remained marginalised, a fact evident in the lateness of the outstanding N38 billion package coming when other APC controlled states like Kogi received theirs and numerous other interventions years back.""Regarding APC fairy tales of disunity in the ranks of our great party, the facts stand tall that Benue PDP under Governor Ortom is arguably the most cohesive and robust state chapter of the party, with all members, high and lowly, fused together in common stakeholding.""Under the governor, the party has adopted ingenious measures in conducting its internal processes and arriving at difficult decisions with unparalleled success, such as the consensus option of nominating candidates.""These are feats the opposition APC vainly tries to criticise, yet at the same time, attempts to copy, but with poor results owing to their unsuitable character as a party run by an individual for his benefit, that of his family members and selected cronies.""APC in Benue State as things stand once again is dodging the trail of issues and facts based campaigning, as it did in 2019, and is desperately hoping lies, insults, propaganda and possibly external forces will catapult it to victory in 2023"".",Benue 2023: Heavier Defeat Awaits You PDP Tells APC

867,"I just finished reading the piece by Fredrick Nwabufo where he was accusing Peter Obi’s supporters of de-marketing him with their aggressive support and illiberality to divergent opinion on Obi.This position of his is in consonance with similar allegation that had been laid by Reno Omokri.But the question is, are Peter Obi’s supporters really de-marketing him or enemies of Nigeria who do not want Nigeria’s progress are finally looking for what to pin against him?When in 2019, the same set of people projecting Peter Obi today were ‘Atikulating’, nobody accused them of being clannish, tribal, illiberal, intemperate and all the negative adjectives they are using to qualify them today. No. The youths were hailed for daring to take their destiny in their hands by finally deciding to participate in politics and political discourse in campaigning for the better candidate amongst those in display.But what has changed? Or is it because Peter Obi is an Igbo man?This reminds me of the article I once read here on Nairaland that asked why Igbos are always set a higher bar than their fellow countrymen?If other tribes divide their votes between two candidates, it’s called sophistication but if the Igbos do the same, they are tagged disunited.If Igbos support one of their own, they are accused of being tribal and clannish but if they decide to support others over their fellow Igbo they are accused of not supporting their own but expecting others to support him.If an Igbo man sneezes they will say he should have coughed; he decides to cough and they will say he should have sneezed. Wither shall we turn and we are right? Honestly there’s a heaviness in my heart.Now, one of the (false) allegation was that Peter Obi’s supporters are from a particular section of the country, nay Igbos. But how true is that claim? Let’s use the now deleted poll of AIT on Twitter which garnered about 30,000 votes before it was deleted as a reference point, do you mean to tell me that out of the 82% of the 30,000 votes that Peter Obi garnered, that non are from other part of the country? They are all Igbos?Tell me which candidate among those who have declared interest in the 2023 presidency is better than Peter Obi and why. Because in all honesty, the next person that comes closest to Peter Obi, in all ramification, is Osinbajo. But how close is he to Peter Obi? Does he possess his knowledge of the economy? Can he truly extricate himself from the failures of APC and the economic shambles our country is in, being the chair of the economy by virtue of his position as Vice President?The thing is simple. Obi’s supporters are not some herd of unintelligent people but a community of highly cerebral and informed men and women who have taken their time to mirror the politicians in parade and decided that Peter Obi fits into the kind of president we want for our country.And for the records, Obi’s supporters cut across all of Nigeria; Igbo, Yoruba, Hausa, Ijaw, Tiv, etc, and that ethnic tag on him will never stick and his candidacy will never be jinxed.Mynd44Lalasticlala",Are Peter Obi’s Supporters Really De-marketing Him?

It is better to go into a battle with a few committed soldiers, than a mix multitude of egotistic and overrated individuals.While not downplaying the political abilities of a few in their midst, however most seem to have an hyperbolic impression of themselves and need to be brought back to earth with a resounding thud. Fact is, most of the so called Aggrieved Members have no relevance politically or electorally. Obviously, that's why the governor and the party hierarchy at the state and national levels didn't take them too seriously. What they did, while in PDP, was to draw relevance from attacking the governor. Now that they have removed themselves, we wait to see how mighty they are or will become.They didn't just give up their membership of the party, they did so a long time ago. Their rebellion was birthed when they chose to fight with the leader of the PDP in the state. Though they claimed to be experienced in politics, they failed the simple test of knowing the difference between a Prince and a king. Seyi Makinde the Candidate ( Prince), and Seyi Makinde the Governor ( king), are two different persons.If they are Politically savvy as they claimed, they would have known that the rules of engagement for a Prince is different from that of a King,  It is their inability to discern the difference that has pushed them to the precipice, and they have now taken a political plunge that is bound to end in regrets.These decampees included people who recently got acquainted with politics and those who have been for a while without any meaningful impact; those who have serially lost every election they took part in. Some even lost elections as recently as 2019, while others became an item because their names got mentioned in the same sentence with Governor Makinde. The truth is that the political strength of these so called party heavy weights are limited to their single vote. All Motion, no Mass. They have been weighed in the balance and they came up short.If one were to carefully analyse the quality of those who recently left the PDP on the basis of their political or electoral value, it will be out of magnanimity and excessive generosity that they will be considered as paper weightsIt will be recalled that upon the conclusion of the Oyo State PDP Congress and National Convention wherein winners emerged, the purported internal wranglings within the Oyo PDP should have been over with everyone knowing their place in the scheme of things.His victory notwithstanding, the Governor of Oyo state, His Excellency, Engr Seyi Makinde, in his usual magnanimous and self-effacing manner, did not rub it on the faces of his traducers. Rather, he urged the newly-elected executives of the party in the state to seek reconciliation with the so-called aggrieved members to move the party forward.  The governor made reasonable efforts to reconcile with them, yet they spurned his extended hand of fellowship.Chief amongst them, is a certain self-acclaimed leader,  who before now, had not achieved anything politically. Someone who never held an office, either elected or appointed, yet for some queer reasons, thinks he is the Mojo that brought Makinde to the Government House.Makinde is God's project, and no one can rule over a people without God saying so. That these set of Party members were part of the process doesn't make them the beginning and the end. Now that they have left,  they will come to the realization that the Almighty only used them as a tool towards achieving an objective. Come 2023, God will do it again in a grandiose way without them. Perhaps then, they will comprehend that there is a God who is interested in the affairs of men and has chosen Seyi Makinde.Governor Oluseyi Abiodun Makinde, within the space of three years, has written his name in the hearts of the people of Oyo state. He needs no one to market him before them. His good deeds are evident in every sector of the state, and his pact is with the People of Oyo state who he has promised to serve, not with ""Belly First"" Politicians.Eagerly, the people are waiting to say thank you to his Excellency with their votes, come 2023.Seyi Makinde lekan si!!!Omolere Omoetan",Oyo PDP : Makinde And The Departure Of Political Deadweights // Omolere Omoetan

884,"Ali Mazrui called it the ""The Tripple Heritage"" ; the tragedy that is the undoing of our Country Nigeria..read on:-EVERY NIGERIAN THAT LOVES NIGERIA OUGHT TO READ THIS WITH PATIENCE.The biggest country in Africa that the United Kingdom colonized is Nigeria.The biggest country that the United Kingdom colonized in Asia is India (which then comprised the present Pakistan and Bangladesh).When the UK came into Nigeria and India, like all other countries they colonized, they brought along their technology, religion (Christianity), and culture: names, dressing, food, language, etc.Try as hard as the British did, India rejected the British religion, names, dressing, food, and even language, but they did not reject the British technology.Today, 80.5% of Indians are Hindus; 13.4% Muslims; 2.3% Christians; 1.9% Sikhs; 0.8% Buddhists, etc.Hindi is the official language of the government of India, but English is used extensively in business and administration and has the status of a “subsidiary official language.”It is rare to find an Indian with an English name or dressed On the other hand, Nigeria embraced, to a large extent, the British religion, British culture – names, dressing, foods, and language – but rejected the British technology.The difference between the Nigerian and the Indian experiences is that while India is proud of its heritage, Nigeria takes little pride in its heritage, a situation that has affected the nationalism of Nigerians and our development as a nation.Before the advent of Christianity, the Arabs had brought Islam into Nigeria through the North.Islam also wiped away much of the culture of Northern Nigeria.Today, the North has only Sharia Courts but no Customary Courts.So from the North to the South of Nigeria, the Western World and the EasternWorld have shaped our lives to be like theirs and we have lost much or all of our identity.Long after the British and Arabs left Nigeria, Nigeria has waxed strong in religion to the extent that Nigerians now set up religious branches of their homegrown churches in Europe, the Americas, Asia and other African countries.Just like the Whites brought the gospel to us, Nigerians now take the gospel back to the Whites.In Islam, we are also very vibrant to the extent that if there is a blasphemous comment against Islam in Denmark or the US, even if there is no violent reaction in Saudi Arabia, the Islamic headquarters of the world, there will be loss of lives and destruction of property in Nigeria.If the United Arab Emirates, a country with 75% Muslims, is erecting the tallest building in the world and encouraging the world to come and invest in its country by providing a friendly environment, Boko Haram ensures that the economy of the North (and by extension that of Nigeria) is crippled with bombs and bullets unless every Nigerian converts to Boko Haram’s brand of Islam.In the East we have IPOB.While in the South - South region, Mend, Avengers and so on destroying the Heart of our Nations Economy.We are indeed a very religious people.Meanwhile, while we are building the biggest churches and mosques, the Indians, South Africans, Chinese, Europeans and Americans have taken over our key markets: telecoms, satellite TV, multinationals, banking, oil and gas, automobile, aviation, shopping malls, hospitality, etc.Ironically, despite our exploits in religion, we are a people with little godliness, a people without scruples.It is rare to do business with a Nigerian pastor, deacon, knight, elder, brother, sister, imam, mullah, mallam, alhaji or alhaja without the person laying landmines of bribes and deception on your path.We call it PR, facilitation fee, processing fee, transport money, financial engineering, deal, or whatever.But if it does not change hands, nothing gets done.And when it is amassed, we say it is “God’s blessings.”Some people assume that sleaze is a problem of public functionaries, but the private sector seems to be worse than the public sector these days.One would have assumed that the more churches and mosques that spring up in every nook and cranny of Nigeria, the higher themorals in our society.But it is not so.The situation is that the more religious we get, more ungodly we become.Our land never knew the type of bloodshed experienced from religious extremists, political desperadoes, ritual killers, armed robbers, kidnappers, internet scammers, university cultists, and lynch mobs.Life has become so cheap and brutish that everyday seems to be a bonanza.We import the petroleum that we have in abundance, rice and beans that our land can produce in abundance, and even toothpicks that primary school children can produce with little or no effort.Yet we drive the best of cars and live in the best of edifices, visit the best places in the world for holidays and use the most expensive electronic and telecoms gadgets.It is now a sign of poverty for a Nigerian to ride a saloon car. Four-wheel drive is it!Even government officials, who were known to use only Peugeot cars as official cars as a sign of modesty, have upgraded to Toyota Prado, without any iota of shame, in a countrywhere about 70 per cent live below poverty.Private jets have become a common toy for many citizens who have no known business.A nation that imports toothpicks and pins, flaunts wealth and wallows in ostentation at a time its children are trooping to Ghana, South Africa and the UK for university educationand its sick people are running to India for treatment.India produces automobile and exports it to the world. India’s medical care is second to none, with even Americans and Europeanstravelling to the country for medical treatment.India has joined the nuclear powers. India has launched a successful mission to the moon.Yet bicycles and tricycles are common sights in India. But in Nigeria, only the wretched of the earth ride bicycles.I have intentionally chosen to compare Nigeria with India rather than China, South Korea, Brazil, Malaysia, or Singapore, because of the similarities between India and Nigeria. But these countries were not as promising as Nigeria at the time of our independence.Some would say that our undoing is our size: the 2012 United Nations estimate puts Nigeria’s population at 166 million, while India has a population of about a billion.Some would blame it on the multiplicity of ethnic groups: we have 250 ethnic groups; India has more than 2000 ethnic groups.Some would hang it on the diversity in religion: we have two major religions – Christianity and Islam; but India has many.Some would say it is because we are young as an independent nation: we have 56 years of independence; India has 65 years, while apartheid ended in South Africa only in 1994.We need more godliness than religion; more work and less hope; and more action and less words.Let everyone tidy up his or her corner first and demand fervently that our leaders tidy their areas of governance. Our nation is degenerating at a fast pace and we need to save it now.We as a people must positively change our attitude towards our dear country!Please SHARE this with every Nigerian you know.",Nigeria At 60: The Horible Story(nigeria Vs India

Adamu Garba who was seeking for the presidential ticket of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC declared his withdrawal from the party on Wednesday stating that he could no longer tolerate the path APC is taking.The politician and tech expert who lamented the price tag on the party’s presidential forms among others said APC has shown in the last few days that it is more concerned about money than settling for competency. He said he could no longer accept anything that could truncate the country’s democracy and freedom, hence the decision to leave APC.The presidential aspirant in a thread of tweets on Thursday morning apologized to Nigerian youths for his previous actions that might have hurt them.Garba assured the public that he is now a fully reformed, baptized person, adding that he has realized some of his mistakes and is ready to move along with the youths to chat a new course for the future of Nigeria, Naija News reports.His statement reads: “Dear Nigerian Youth, I write to sincerely apologize for any of my actions or inactions that might have affected our relationship over time.“Though inexcusable, I took these actions due to the following reasons:“1. I’m a radical patriotic Nigerian and can’t stand anything that threatens the stability and security of this country.“2. I had such high hopes that things will eventually get better, even as lightest worst.“3. I do not accept anything that could truncate our democracy & freedom.“It appears I was wrong in some ways, because things didn’t eventually get better, and in fact, it kept getting worst.“I kept my hopes alive with the belief that changes can better be made from within. But is clear to me that in APC there are no plans or future for innovative youth.“Painfully so is the over-financialisation of the political atmosphere.“In a third world country where money is generated from natural resources & not human brains, once financialised, there will be no incentive for human lives to get better.Garba added: “Resource will be the focus of leaders. This means, to some extent people should keep dying and giving up on the country than living and staying here.“The more they die or suffer or vacate the country, the less competition and pressure on the resources. That’s why our leaders don’t care, but we should.“I promise you that I am now fully reformed, baptized and have realized some of my mistakes. I’m ready to move along with you to chat a new course for the future of Nigeria.“We can’t do this with leaders living in the past.“I have a new deal for you. A NEW DEAL for the future.

You know me, as I endeavor to speak my mind, no filters, no packaging so that you can continue to make & shape me.“You have shaped me enough, it is time to test me.

Ijaws were unjustly balkanized into six Nigerian States to weaken Ijaw Unity.Ijaw asked for a region of its own in the 60s because Ijaw occupy space as big as the South East of Nigeria of which no Igbo state is homogeneous Igbo state.  That was why NDDB was created so that all Ijaw areas will be observerd for some number of years with development before a region is created.Ijaw produces over 90 percent of all Nigeria's crude oil but were unjustly balkanized into six States of which are Ondo, Edo,Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers and Akwa-Ibom States when all Ijaw areas are together and share perfect boundaries with each other.Ijaw is the tribe that deserves to be shouting self determination most.If Nigeria disintegrate Ijaws are going for Ijaw Republic because Ijaws are more than large enough to rule themselves.4th largest tribe out of 350 tribes is not a play number.Many Ijaws believe Ijaws are larger than 4th largest tribe.They don't cross the creeks to count Ijaw they only count Ijaw by Proxy.",Many Truths About The Ijaws That Will Shock You!!!
905,"By Abdul SeyeIn the past 48hours, two aspirants from the north, Sani Yerima and Abubakar Bagudu have declared interest in the presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC).Mr Yerima already picked the form of the party, after addressing his supporters at the Nicon Luxury hotel in Abuja. In addition, the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan is believed to be consulting in a bid to join the race.The new entrants from the north are generating concerns in the South because of the number of persons that have so far declared in the South.As of Friday, only States in the south that have no aspirants are: Osun, Oyo and Bayelsa States.For instance, Ogun State has four aspirants; Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, former Governor Ibikunle Amosun, Pastor Tunde Bakare and former Speaker Dimeji Bankole.In some states, there are two aspirants. In Ebonyi, Governor David Umahi and Minister for Science and Technology, Ogbonnaya Onu.Similarly, in Imo State, there is former Governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha and Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajuiba.Others in the race are Kayode Fayemi, the governor of Ekiti State, the Governor of Cross River, Prof. Ben Ayade, former Senate President, Ken Nnamani, Minister of Labour Chris Ngige, former Labour Leader, Adams Oshiomole, Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio, Sen Boroffice Ajayi, Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi and others.During the week, the Governor of Ondo State and Chairman of Southern Governors’ Forum, Rotimi Akeredolu had raised the alarm on the possibility of the ticket slipping from the grip of the South.In a statement, he urged the party to zone the ticket to the south, in the name of justice, equity and fairness.Governor Akeredolu warned: “It is expedient that we avoid self-inflicted crises before the general elections. It is the turn of the Southern part of the country to produce the next president. The party leadership should have no difficulty in making pronouncements on this very important issue, just as it has fixed various fees for the purchase of forms.”While the leadership of the party is yet to heed the call by Akeredolu, politicians from the South are in full frenzy in picking up the N100 million form. In all, about 24 aspirants have either declared or bought the nomination form.It is not just Akeredolu that is concerned. Edwin Clark, an elder statesman, while speaking with journalists in Abuja on Monday, described the buying of forms by southern politicians as “madness”.He accused South-West and South-South aspirants in the race of playing a double game.In reaction, the former Governor of Osun State, Bisi Akande and his colleague from Ogun State, Segun Osoba convened a meeting of the aspirants from the South-West in a bid to reduce the number of aspirants, which stands at 7 as of the time of filing this story.The chances of changing the minds of the contestants may prove difficult because most of the aspirants have paid the N100 million nomination form and expression of interest.“Unfortunately, the president has been giving nods to everyone, unfortunately for the party, this is not going to be like the national convention. Nobody can order anyone to step down,” a source in the camp of one of the aspirants told DAILY POST.DAILY POST learnt that the southwest meeting did not achieve the intent of reducing the aspirants from the region.Initially, it was only governor Yahaya Bello that was in the race from the North. For most of the aspirants, Bello appears not to pose a threat, because he is from the North Central.“With Bello, we know that he is not going anywhere, but a candidate from the northwest is a threat, particularly with the indirect primary.“In the South-West, delegates are divided, same in the South-East and South-South. A candidate from any of the core north could take the ticket at the primary,” the source said.The ruling party already extended the time for the sale of the forms till the 12th of May, which means there is likelihood of having more aspirants, including some from the north.Insiders within the party are concerned about the likelihood of the Peoples Democratic Party picking a northern candidate with a strong following and the resultant effect on the chances of the party.It would be recalled that most aspirants from the north in the PDP have argued that the party must consider picking a candidate from the north, in order to defeat the APC.There are persons within the APC who also have the same concern about picking a southern candidate against a northern candidate.Rivalry in the southSeveral aspirants from the South-East have frowned against the quest by candidates from the South-South and South-West. Orji Uzor Kalu, the former governor of Abia State, who is also in the race, in a letter, said if the party cannot zone their ticket to the South-East, then the contest should be thrown open.“The reality is that the North is more advantageous to winning elections in this democratic setting. I am even shocked with the number of aspirants coming from the South-West and the South-South.“It is embarrassing that these aspirants (APC and PDP) have no single respect and concern for the South East,” he said.On Friday, David Umahi, the governor of Ebonyi State, in an interview on Channels TV, also slammed the candidates from the other two regions for not giving the South-East the opportunity in view of the fact that the region is yet to get the opportunity for a democratically elected president or vice.With all these challenges in the South, the possibility of a northern candidate emerging seems likely.https://dailypost.ng/2022/05/07/apc-presidential-ticket-panic-in-south-as-northern-aspirants-plot-major-shocker/",APC Presidential Ticket: Panic In South As Northern Aspirants Plot Major Shocker

Flood takes over Anambra communities as Gov Obi cries for helpGovernor Peter Obi of Anambra State has solicited for assistance to tackle the effects of ravaging floods.. He made this call Saturday while touring the affected local governments of Ayamelu, Ogbaru, Anambra West and Anambra East.The governor, who had a hectic day accessing the affected areas in canoe, cancelled his planned trip to Mexico tomorrow on the reason that it is only a man devoid of feeling for his people that would travel out from the state for whatever reason, while his people faced dangers of death and displacement.”The only trip I am disposed to undertake for now is answering calls to come for aid for the affected communities or for discussions on how to mitigate the suffering of those affected”, the governor said.Governor Peter Obi , with Anglican Bishop of Mbamili, Most Rev. Henry Okeke transversing what was once a sprawling community of Umueze Anam in a boat.In some of the communities he visited, he held meetings with the stakeholders on the best possible way to render immediate assistance to the people. Besides giving directives to his cabinet members from affected communities to stay with their people and take charge of government support to them in the form of relief materials, the state has also set up camps for the displaced and sent vehicles and boats to evacuate those who are trapped in different parts of Anambra including those taking refuge on tree tops.In some of the places visited, flood has completely taken over. Buildings as tall as three stories and palm trees were completely covered by flood.“ We have not borrowed a dime or raised bond, but the crisis we are facing now is better seen than explained. We will continue to do everything possible to see that our people are taken care of even if it means borrowing this time around”, Obi said.At Ogbaru, Obi visited some camps where women were seen cooking food for the displaced.

909,"Sequel to the submission of the APC Nomination and Expression of Interest forms by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, a female support and advocacy group, S.M.A.R.T Women, has appealed to delegates who would be voting in the forthcoming APC presidential primary, at the end of this month, to elect the Professor of Law by giving him the majority of votes.The female group, which had been canvassing for the election of the Vice President as substantive President, come 2023, said it has become evidently clear that Osinbajo is the man Nigerians had been waiting for, as such, the delegates should not miss the opportunity in abiding by the wishes of Nigerians.In a statement issued shortly after Osinbajo submitted his Nomination and Expression of Interest forms in Abuja, the co-conveners of S.M.A.R.T Women for PYO, Mrs Folake Aina and Bunmi Oke, said it is only right that the delegates should listen to voice of wisdom and not cut short the wishes of the people.The women also urged the leadership of the party to ensure that a level playing field is granted to all contestants and let the votes of the delegates count.“It is not only unfortunate that some aspirants are just in the race to test waters, it is highly ridiculous that some of them are withdrawing even before the contest.“While Osinbajo is working very hard, crisscrossing the length and breadth of Nigeria, a lot of others are waiting to be served a la carte.“It is not in doubt that Osinbajo is the most qualified, most suitable and most prepared for the top job, having been in the saddle for seven years and learnt the ropes.“His loyalty to his principal, his passion and dedication for the job and his commitment and patriotism towards a united Nigeria are unparalleled.“Nigeria does not need a greenhorn that will learn on the job. Our country needs someone that will hit the ground running.“And this is why we think it is in the best interest of everybody that the highly cerebral lawyer cum administrator is elected as the candidate of the APC.“Allowing delegates to go through the rigours of a 48-hour contest like we witnessed in 2014 at the Teslim Balogun Stadium in Lagos, without coming out with an acceptable candidate for the party may not help the APC’s course.“It is in the light of this that we passionately appeal the delegates to please use their good conscience in ensuring that a good man, who is the hope of Nigeria emerges.“We all know that the VP will definitely emerge the President of Nigeria in a free, fair and credible election, so why waste time in making him the APC candidate?“It is in the light of these facts, that we are asking to the leadership of the APC and all the delegates to vote Vice President Yemi Osinbajo as thier preferred candidate and also announce him as the lawful custodian of the party’s ticket,” the statement reads.","Vote Osinbajo As APC Candidate, S.M.A.R.T Women Appeal To Delegates"

911,"A popular blogger and Publisher of Sitippe Ke-Akwa Ibom, Mr. Utitofon Morgan Ukpong has warned one Idorenyin Umana, an aide to Senator Bassey Albert against using his name to insult the Governor, Mr. Udom Emmanuel.Idorenyin Umana had few days ago made some inciting and demeaning comments against the Governor, insinuating that Utitofon and several others, are products of a bad reward system. Utitofon in his reaction cautioned Idorenyin Umana, a media consultant to Senator Bassey Albert, against using his name to score cheap political points.Umana and his co-travellers in the Bassey Albert’s Governorship camp have been going haywire since the Governor announced Pastor Umo Bassey Eno as his preferred successor. The Senator’s campaign team members have been launching all manners of attack on the person and office of the Governor, especially in both the social media and select newspapers which they have recruited for the hatchet job. The general anger in their camp is that their Principal should have been picked by the Governor since he had supported the Governor’s ambition previously. For them, since the Governor and other critical stakeholders are not supporting the Uyo Senatorial District senator, the only option left for them is to criticize and attack the same government they once hailed and defended. Idorenyin Umana had listed Utitofon amongst persons whom he feels were not faring better in the current government. But in a swift reaction to Umana's diatribe, Morgan who is a lecturer at the state owned polytechnic had punctured his claim, telling him that he has been beneficiary of the system and would not wish to be dragged into the 2023 brouhaha.His response; ""Ha, my brother Idy, alot of people have drawn my attention to your post in which you mentioned my name as one of those who have not been rewarded by the system"".""As a promoter of this government, I have been a beneficiary of the system.

914,"… Holds Strategic Meeting with NDLEA, Other StakeholdersLagos State First Lady, Dr. Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, has pledged to work with the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) and other critical stakeholders to reinvigorate the war against drug abuse, especially in schools and communities across the state.The First Lady made the pledge on Wednesday at a strategic meeting held in Lagos House, Ikeja, with the NDLEA and other critical stakeholders, including the Wife of the Deputy Governor, Mrs. Oluremi Hamzat, senior officials of the Ministries of Education, Health, Youths and Social Development, wives of Local Government Chairmen, Police Officers Wives Association (POWA), School Principals, Market Women and the Medical Director of the Federal Neuro-Psychiatric Hospital, Yaba, Dr. Gbenga Owoeye.According to her, drug addiction, especially among the youths, has become a worrisome menace in society that no one could longer pretend about its existence.In her words: “The earlier we begin to tackle the daunting challenge, the better for our youths, ourselves and the social health of our society. This strategic meeting is aimed at putting the menace of drug abuse and associated social vices on the front burner”.“We are truly and deeply concerned about the increase in the rate at which the younger ones are now getting addicted to illicit drugs, a development that brought about the need for all relevant stakeholders to embark on a campaign to fight the menace and enlighten victims on the dangers inherent in such lifestyle both now and in the future”, the First Lady said.Maintaining that the time was ripe for real action to tackle the war against drug abuse and not just mere rhetoric, Dr. Sanwo-Olu disclosed that a series of initiatives would be unveiled in the coming weeks to advance the fight against the menace in schools and in communities across the State.She said: “At the level of the Nigerian Governors' Wives Forum (NGWF), we are all concerned about this and we have resolved in our respective States to frontally confront the menace, looking at it from a holistic point of view”.“We have to be proactive and connect with the schools, the religious bodies, community leaders and associations and others to cascade the message to all segments and sectors of the State”, Mrs. Sanwo-Olu asserted.On his part, Commander of the NDLEA, Lagos State Command, Barr. Callys Alumona, commended the First Lady for convening the meeting of relevant stakeholders to advance the War Against Drug Abuse (WADA), noting that something urgent must be done to prevent Lagos from becoming a gateway for illicit and dangerous drugs, both within and outside Nigeria.  He also urged the First Lady to organise a training workshop for women in government who are mothers themselves, as well as political and social leaders, to enable them to have a better understanding of the consequences of drug abuse and the signs to note when a child is engaging in drug abuse or illicit dealing in drugs.","Lagos First Lady To Lead War Against Drug Abuse In Schools, Communities"

926,"The issue of abobaku is a thing of the past. There is a supportive story to bring this to nullity. It goes thus: Some 400 years ago, there used to be an ABOBAKU, whose duty it was to die with his master - the King. When a king dies, the abobaku was to be buried alive with the king. The belief was that if the Abobaku was not buried with the king, the community would record serious calamity. While this lasted, the Colonial Masters came. In the days of Colonialism, the white men came for the purpose of commercialization but hid under religion. As it was difficult to understand the white man's language, an interpreter needed to be engaged. At that time, the best interpreter in the community was the Abobaku. So, he remained the only one going round the community interpreting for the white men. Within few months, the white men found him indispensable in their onerous assignment. Then came the BIG ANNOUNCEMENT: The Oba passed on. He was to be buried within 7 days. Consequently, the Abobaku must be prepared to bid the world farewell. Being an indispensable instrument in the hands of the Oyinbos, his masters devised a method to safe him. The second day after the demise of the Oba, Policemen came calling at his house, accusing him of stealing a goat. The same day of his arrest, the Abobaku was jailed for life. The tradition was for the king to be buried within seven days. On the 6th day, when it dawned on the palace chiefs that the Abobaku would not be available for the 7th day assignment, as he was sentenced to life imprisonment, it was decided that a life cow should be used as NO OTHER HUMAN BEING COULD REPLACE HIM as a tradition. And so, the Oba was buried without the Abobaku. Surprisingly, nothing calamitous happened. This was what marked the end of the obnoxious tradition in Yorubaland. This formed the basis for the adage: ENI OYINBO BA FERAN LOYINBO N TI MOLE. The white men did not want the Abobaku to die, so, they framed him up with stealing charges and jailed him only to release him a day after the burial of the Oba. My people, let the world know that there is nothing like ABOBAKU again in Yorubaland..Good daySourceStory as told by Chief Kemade ElugbajuCc lalasticlala kindly put this in the right section",The Real Story Behind Abobaku (a Long Abolished Tradition)

928,"Gombe state Governor, Inuwa Yahaya, has pledged the support of his administration and the entire All Progressives Congress APC delegates from the state for the presidential ambition of Ekiti state Governor and Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum, Dr John Kayode Fayemi.The development was disclosed in a statement issued Thursday in Abuja by the spokesman of the Kayode Fayemi Campaign Team, Femi Ige.He said Governor Yahaya who received the campaign team of the Ekiti State Governor led by a former Deputy National Chairman of the APC, explained that with Governor Fayemi’s deep knowledge as Chairman of the Nigerian Governors’ Forum, “he is undeniably the best among the presidential aspirants who have been here and we will back you to the end,”Continuing, Governor Yahaya said; “Fayemi has widely acknowledged experience, energy capacity, and deep knowledge. These are the qualities we need at this critical moment in Nigeria. My brother Fayemi, you have our support because we are convinced that Nigeria needs you. I have been encouraged by your consensus building capabilities and I personally encouraged you to step out for the big job and I am happy that you have taken up the challenge”.Responding, the Ekiti governor thanked his Gombe counterpart and the delegates for the reception, promising not to take the endorsement and the love shown him for granted.Fayemi hinged the core programme of his government if elected on Security, Economy, Energy and Job Creation.The presidential aspirant said: “Any government who can successfully tackle these would have succeeded in bringing happiness to our country, discourage the urge to secede and address our perennial problem of youth restiveness. I believe I have the education, the energy, the capacity and the knowledge to tackle these myriad of problems” the governor added.Noting that he may not be the richest among the aspirants, Fayemi said “history has shown us that the richest or children of the richest have never ruled Nigeria.“Tafawa Balewa was a teacher, Shagari a headmaster, Obasanjo had no money when he left prison, Umaru Yar’Adua was a university teacher, Jonathan had no shoes and of course we know the background of our current president. What Nigeria needs now are education, capacity, energy, experience which I have in abundance.“Nigeria needs a president who will make the Onitsha man feel comfortable in Sokoto and the Kano man to feel at home in Ibadan or Awka. I feel this best describes me and I promise not to let you down,” he pledged.https://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/05/2023-gombe-governor-yahaya-endorses-fayemis-presidential-ambition/","2023: Gombe Governor, Yahaya Endorses Fayemi’s Presidential ambition."

935,"President Muhammadu Buhari’s aide, Bashir Ahmad has all but confirmed the defection of the former Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan from the Peoples Democratic Party to the All Progressives Congress, APC.Bashir in a tweet on Thursday morning while responding to those who questioned his earlier prediction that Goodluck Jonathan would defect to the ruling party said he knows what others don’t know.He added that not everything is executed on social media.Following the rejection of the presidential form from the Fulani group, many Nigerians had doubted the possibility of Goodluck Jonathan joining the All Progressives Congress Party.Bashir tweeted: “When I shared the news of former President Jonathan joining our party, his uninformed supporters insulted me saying it can never happen even in the wildest dream”“They should know that we know something they don’t know and not everything is planned and executed on social media”.It would be recalled that Jonathan became Nigeria’s president under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP.He, however, lost his second term bid to President Muhammadu Buhari in 2015.https://www.naijanews.com/2022/05/12/2023-buharis-aide-confirms-jonathans-defection-to-apc/",Bashir Ahmad: i know for a fact Goodluck Jonathan Is Now A Member Of APC
936," Former President Goodluck Jonathan has rejected some of the conditions given to him by members of the Aso Rock (Presidency) cabal to get the 2023 presidential automatic ticket of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), SaharaReporters has gathered.One of the conditions was that Jonathan must officially defect to the APC with some Peoples Democratic Party governors in the South-South and South-East regions.The cabal, comprising some members of President Muhammadu Buhari’s extended family and friends, are the powers behind the throne.This group is said to have the ear of the President, influence policy-making and determine those who get major appointments.Sources told SaharaReporters that the former President rejected the conditions and told the cabal he doesn’t have interest in the 2023 presidency again.His response, it was gathered, embarrassed the cabal members who described the former President as a traitor.“They are now accusing Jonathan of not fulfilling some of his promises after all the several meetings and soft-landing given to him.“He was to come on board by converting some PDP states in the South-South and South-East to APC, and that way he would get the automatic ticket uncontested. Some other conditions were also given to him.“But guess what? He told them he won't contest again. They are now angry, saying he was deceitful. They said after getting some of his seized monies back, his wife’s monies returned to him, he finally decided not to contest,” a top source told SaharaReporters on Thursday.SaharaReporters had reported that members of the ‘Aso Rock cabal’ had promised Jonathan the 2023 presidential ticket of the ruling APC.It was also reported that the cabal members had warned the President against handing over to the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo and Bola Tinubu, the national leader of the party.“Buhari’s cabal members have asked Jonathan to prepare for the party’s ticket. They said they don’t want Tinubu or Osibanjo,” a presidential source had told SaharaReporters.SaharaReporters earlier reported how the cabal had been pressuring Jonathan to defect to the APC.He was said to have surprised the northern elite and the cabal by his disposition to the Buhari presidency despite all the dirt and campaign of calumny thrown at him and the PDP before the 2015 presidential election, which gave Buhari an unprecedented victory over an incumbent.It was learnt that some cabal members had also been impressed that despite the Buhari government's glaring failure, Jonathan had not openly criticised his predecessor or his administration, much unlike ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo.Obasanjo had written open letters condemning the Buhari government and also verbally berated it at any opportunity.SaharaReporters learnt from sources that the establishment of 'Almajiri' schools by Jonathan to reduce a large number of out-of-school children in the North also scored the former president good points in the eyes of the northern cabal in the APC, especially with most of it now rotting away, even under a northerner as president.http://saharareporters.com/2022/03/31/exclusive-jonathan-rejects-aso-rock-cabal’s-conditions-getting-apc-automatic-presidential",Jonathan Rejects Aso Rock Cabal’s Conditions For Getting APC Presidential Ticket
937,"My Decision on MOP2023: I was ""Not Cleared"" to Contest but we won't stop thereI'm presently heartbroken because everyone can bear witness to the fact that I have paid my Dues in APGA and I came into the election with 10 amazing attributes that can’t be matched by anyone in same race, vis à viz; Qualification/Quality, Capacity, Experience, Community Service, Human Capital Development, Youth Oriented, Readiness, Entrepreneurship, Accessibility, and Sacrifice & Contributions to the party.When I saw the results signed by the Secretary of APGA Screening Committee for Anambra State House of Assembly and available online indicating that, ""I was not cleared""; instead of fighting it, I pleaded for calm from my supporters, friends and well wishers especially the good people of Njikoka II State Constituency who were most hurt by that decision, and headed to appeal believing that the appeal panel will have enough reasons to upturn that decision.In my Appeal To Be Cleared, I stated clearly that:1. I am a very loyal and committed party man who has sacrificed almost all I have, in the last 11 years, in supporting our party from the ward level upwards; I have given my all in marketing APGA as a top social media influencer and a member of the past administration in Anambra where I served as an Executive Assistant and later as a Senior Special Assistant to the Governor before becoming the Director-General of Anambra State Digital Entrepreneurship Office till my handover in March 17, 2022.2. I have served as a Ward Cordinator of APGA, served as Personal Assistant to Njikoka LG Party Chairman and I led the Social Media team that ensured 21-over-21 flawless victory of the party in the 2017 Gubernatorial Election in Anambra State... At a time, I led the #SouthEastIsAPGA Campaign. 3. In all these I spent my resources, talent and time to ensure that APGA wins and in two occasions, I was shot by armed groups in an effort to diminish my towering influence in promoting APGA.4. I have not known any other political party or worked against APGA but have always burnt everything I own in service to the party, APGA.5. In the last Guber election in Anambra State, I spent over N3.5m in convening the APGA Digi-Family which championed the #APGAFirst Campaign to ensure unity of our online players aimed at galvanising maximum support for APGA through the Social Media.6. Not clearing me is unjust; thus, I passionately prayed the Appeal Panel to upturn the decision of the Screening Committee and clear me; because loyal and experienced party men like us are needed in the State Assembly to support our dear Governor, Prof Soludo in building a liveable and prosperous Anambra State.This 6-Point Appeal fell on deaf ears and momentarily, I lost my sense of life; the days that followed became so uneasy for everyone; for me, for you and for all our supporters, even our supposed opponents.My pain wasn't just for what happened but how it happened:1. Not clearing me based on hearsay and clearing many others who have facts and evidences of their transgressions against our Party;2. Not giving any reason for not clearing me;3. Not showing me any petition or the petitioner to help me explain myself to the Appeal Panel.[b]I was beaten, shattered and left in the cold to die alone with only rumours flying around on why I was not cleared; some say:1. That I betrayed APGA and joined APCWill it be a rumour if I join APC? Won't it be a National News?... So, I didn't join APC!2. That I didn't support Prof SoludoBut I convened the APGA Digi-Family holding meetings, hangouts and campaigns with uniforms and even celebrated the victory of Prof Soludo in APGA Primaries with most Soludo Media team in attendance and Anambra State Speaker as Guest of Honour... So, I contributed hugely as evidenced by pictures and videos online!3. That APGA lost my ward in the last Guber ElectionAPGA has never lost my Ward since I joined the party and I have never lost the 2 Polling Units under me except in the last election where we lost by 4 votes ONLY in one of the booths... So, it's a Lie!4. That I traveled to Burundi with Amb Elijah OnyeagbaHow does traveling to prospect tourism business at my own expense alongside some of my partners become a crime? Isn't it a privilege that my personal friend is an Ambassador?5. That Stanel CEO is my bossIs it a crime to have a successful young man as a mentor. Is it wrong to learn from Dr Stanley Uzochukwu whose slot got me into the 2nd tenure of Gov Willie Obiano's administration?[/b]While I wept over the first, second and third reasons which are false, I got depressed over numbers 4 and 5 which can never be a reason to deny my people the right to true representation. Brethren, I felt very bad, deeply hurt and downcast; especially when I discovered that those who masterminded the gangup against me are my fellow young persons, my co-aspirants and a few others I dine and wine with.So, that ""Not Cleared"" to contest stand of APGA shocked me, my team and many, especially the good people of Njikoka II State Constituency in Anambra State;But we can't be weakened by obstacles deliberately placed to deny our people the best; instead we'll be emboldened to make greater impact via better pathways!Thus, after due consultation with my people, the grassroots, critical Stakeholders as well as my mentors and benefactors, on the way forward;I have decided to make this decision which I strongly believe to be the best for me, for you, for us and for my people!I know this decision will make some unhappy and even give a few persons the opportunity to attack me but most importantly, it will give me and my team the opportunity to pursue our life long ambition which is to serve my people. I'm staying put in APGA, not as a coward but as a fellow whose loyalty can never be questioned... My time in the fastest growing political party in Africa, is not up!We fought a good fight, we garnered support from far and near, from many very positive beings as well as received attacks, insults and bits of blackmail, from a few negative humans;We have options to seek for alternative vehicle in running for this election come 2023 but like I have always preached, we must put #APGAFirst in our thoughts, words and actions; and Party is Supreme.I prefer to believe that the APGA Leadership have another reason not to clear me other than those rumours as stated above, so I submit to Party's Supremacy!And this statement serves as my first step in seeking for closure in this heartwrenching development.Once again, I sincerely thank all the persons that stood up for me, the people that stuck their necks out for me, fellows that reachedout to check on me;Fans, supporters and party men and women who shared in the resulting agony especially the Anambra Social Media family... I love you all!Super kudos to my crew, the Team Digi-Priest led by Samuel Dan, Henry Chendo and Chisom Mary-Anne Egungwu... I owe you plenty! ...If this my decision annoys you, please forgive! I was ""Not Cleared"" to Contest but we won't stop there; we shall continue to do good and hope for the best.May We All Be Our Brothers' Keepers, At All Times!I'm still your dearest Digi-Priest,Engr Ifeanyi ANIAGOHỌzọ Ọganiru Abagana na Ụmụ-Owelle.#TeamDigiPriest ..Source:https://www.facebook.com/1097821717/posts/10226211557490876....Cc..Alexreports, Gleesmodel........The guy should request formally for the screening panel and the appeal panel to let him know the reason why he was screened out.(He should use the “Freedom of Information Act” format)..If they refuse to give him the information that he need, he can take them to court, so that they can tell him in clear white-and-black terms what his actual offence was.",Ifeanyi Aniagoh Reacts To His “Not Cleared” Status; Pledges To St Remain In APGA

This strategic meeting is aimed at putting the menace of drug abuse and associated social vices on the front burner”.“We are truly and deeply concerned about the increase in the rate at which the younger ones are now getting addicted to illicit drugs, a development that brought about the need for all relevant stakeholders to embark on a campaign to fight the menace and enlighten victims on the dangers inherent in such lifestyle both now and in the future”, the First Lady said.Maintaining that the time was ripe for real action to tackle the war against drug abuse and not just mere rhetoric, Dr. Sanwo-Olu disclosed that a series of initiatives would be unveiled in the coming weeks to advance the fight against the menace in schools and in communities across the State.She said: “At the level of the Nigerian Governors' Wives Forum (NGWF), we are all concerned about this and we have resolved in our respective States to frontally confront the menace, looking at it from a holistic point of view”.“We have to be proactive and connect with the schools, the religious bodies, community leaders and associations and others to cascade the message to all segments and sectors of the State”, Mrs. Sanwo-Olu asserted.On his part, Commander of the NDLEA, Lagos State Command, Barr. Callys Alumona, commended the First Lady for convening the meeting of relevant stakeholders to advance the War Against Drug Abuse (WADA), noting that something urgent must be done to prevent Lagos from becoming a gateway for illicit and dangerous drugs, both within and outside Nigeria.  He also urged the First Lady to organise a training workshop for women in government who are mothers themselves, as well as political and social leaders, to enable them to have a better understanding of the consequences of drug abuse and the signs to note when a child is engaging in drug abuse or illicit dealing in drugs.","Lagos First Lady To Lead War Against Drug Abuse In Schools, Communities"

According to new media reports, first quarter January-March 2022, statistics presented at a meeting in Abuja between the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission  (NUPRC), Oil Producers Trade Section  and the Independent Petroleum Producers Group (IPPG), revealed that USD$3.2 billion (NGN1.36 trillion naira) worth of crude oil was stolen from Nigeria between January 2021 and February 2022!The worst hit areas were the Bonny Terminal Network, Forcados Terminal Network, and the Brass Terminal Network which is notorious for persistent pipeline vandalisation!Except for the stack illiterates, Nigerians are fully aware that crude oil theft in Nigeria had always been organised crimes masterminded by insiders in government who are the greatest beneficiaries of the national economic sabotage of the worst kind because crude oil is the only foreign exchange earner produce for the country!AND WHEREAS NIGERIA HAS FOUR REFINERIES - TWO IN PORT HARCOURT AND ONE EACH IN KADUNA AND WARRI - WITH A COMBINED CAPACITY OF 445,000 BARRELS PER DAY. ALL FOUR REFINERIES ARE NON-FUNCTIONAL AFTER BEING SHUT DOWN IN 2020!Nigerian taxpayers should take note that while workers of these four refineries were redundant Federal Government kept paying salaries to them.AND to add insult to injury in March 2021 Federal Executive Council (FEC), presided over by President Major General Muhammadu Buhari approved another sum of USD$1.5  billion dollars for another round of refurbishing the 32 year-old Port Harcourt Refinery.We have it on good authority that Nigeria has spent about USD$25 billion US dollars in turn- around maintenance of refineries in the past 25 years and these refineries are not refining any crude oil!An NNPC audit report in 2020 revealed that three of the four refineries recorded NGN1.64 trillion naira cumulative losses between 2014 and 2018. It further stated that the combined losses from the Port Harcourt Refinery and Kaduna Refinery were NGN 208.6 billion naira in 2014; NGN 252.8 billion in 2015; NGN 290.6 billion naira in 2016; NGN 412 billion in 2017 and NGN 475 billion in 2018!It is a general principle for NNPC to export Nigerian crude oil overseas for refining at great losses to the Nigerian government which in turn has been deceiving Nigerians in respect of phantom Oil SUBSIDIES which amount into trillions of naira annually BUT with no visible dividends for the Citizens other than increased hardship to procure the divinely-endowed natural resource through corruption-induced and persistent artificial scarcity!Presently the sum of NGN 4 trillion naira is to be spent on fuel subsidy for the year 2022; an amount that was not reflected in the annual budget for the year!NIGERIA‘S ADOPTED PRESIDENTIAL SYSTEM IS CORRUPTION-LADEN AND STINKS TO HIGH HEAVEN!Were it in a sane clime, these set of politicians would all have been arrested and thrown into detention while their president or head of state forced to resigned immediately but that is not to happen in a country headed by military billionaires whose sources of income are shrouded in secrecy and cannot be investigated?At their whims and caprices consecutive Nigerian Presidents have  ENRICHED all of their friends and cronies through personal allocations of Oil Wells, Blocs and Allocations which did not pass through DUE PROCESS and therefore have NEVER be accounted for just like the unconstitutional SECURITY VOTES FOR PRESIDENTS AND GOVERNORS!Up to the year 2020, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), and its subsidiaries in the upstream, middlestream and downstream sectors of the petroleum economy could not (for 45 years), officially reveal nor publish daily lifting of barrels per day (bpd), from the Oil Wells and as such it has been a free for all comers!But in that year a PERFORMANCE DATA which included the 2020 audited financial statements propped up since 1977 when NNPC was first established. The data constitute the following information1) NNPC Audited Financial Statements 2) NNPC Monthly Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) Report. 3) Report on crude oil and natural gas production lifting and utilization.4) Report on refinery, gas operations, sales and proceeds.5) Petroleum product supply and distribution report.WHO WERE THOSE REPORTS PUBLISHED FOR? NIGER DELTA PEOPLE OR THE ENTIRE NIGERIAN POPULATION? ARE THE REPORTS AUTHENTIC? WHO WILL BELIEVE THOSE REPORTS?Especially when in spite of the three-year consecutive reports from year 2021-2022, the cabal in government was still able to manipulate the oil sector to the extent that 91% of Nigeria's crude oil was stolen without trace?SO THE QUESTION REMAINS WHO ARE THOSE STEALING NIGERIA’S CRUDE OIL?If the Niger Delta people in whose domain the oil wealth of Nigeria is domicile, who have suffered untold degradation through exploration and exploitation and after several years of protests and even militant activities resolved to construct their own local refineries to make money out of the “GOOSE THAT LAYS THE GOLDEN EGGS” on  their soil, should they not be ENCOURAGED THROUGH LEGAL FRAMEWORK TO BUILD LOCAL REFINERIES AND PAY TAXES TO GOVERNMENT?IT IS AN OPEN SECRET THAT CONSERVATIVE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENTS SINCE 1999 HAVE DELIBERATELY REFUSED TO BUILD NEW REFINERIES BUT KEPT “REFURBISHING” THE OLD ONES BUILT DURING THE MILITARY ERA TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE CORRUPT OFFICERS AND POLITICIANS TO MAKE ILLICIT MONIES WHICH IS THE HALLMARK OF THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION WHICH PROMISED TO FIGHT CORRUPTION HEAD LONG!The pre-independence era of Nigerian politics under the watch of the British Colonial Masters did not record massive exhibition of crimes and criminalities which are now festering!In those good old days petty stealing was not commonplace neither were burglaries nor armed robberies!

950,"There is a biblical story of how Jesus Christ was accused of breaking the Sabbath day law. His crime, according to his accusers, was that he was healing people on the Sabbath day which was supposed to be work-free. For the sick ones Jesus healed and others he delivered, all that mattered was that Jesus was their Saviour. So while some saw his acts as criminal, some others saw same acts as what gave them eternal freedom (if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed — John 8:36). For over a year, I've been following unfolding events in the polity of Ikono/Ini Federal Constituency as it concerns the 2023 elections and who their next representative should be, and just like it would be for anyone else, the raised voices in the clamour for zoning did draw my attention. Apparently, the voices forming this sect are of the position that the current Rep, Hon Emmanuel Ukpong-udo, who is from the Ikono divide in the constituency should let go his second term bid and give way to a zoning arrangement which according to them, favours the Ini divide.The writer being himself a maternal indigene of Ini was initially tempted to tilt towards this sentiment, especially with a woman at the Ini end as a possible beneficiary. However, it appeared that while the agitators were struggling to disentangle themselves from the web of having to market a newbie for a legislative succession, and without anything tangible other than a zoning arrangement, the incumbent Ukpong-udo was compounding their misery by giving them much more work to do by doubling the records of performance. Such commitment to mandate delivery is not one to even place on same pedestal for comparison with a zoning arrangement that does not guarantee a matching, let alone, better replacement.For all it matters in democracy, popularity and competence should lead the list of criteria, and same, the incumbent Ukpong-udo has so far invested above average efforts in passing the test. Just like any government or administration will pick an area of focus, his representation had picked human capital development to focus on, and the deliveries have been widely admitted to be superlative.Matter of fact, he has made this focus appear much more like a passion by running a representative campaign originally structured to broaden the three core areas of legislation (lawmaking, oversighting and representation) to cover Welfare and Economic Empowerment, Employment and Job Creation, Education and Human Capital Development, as well as Infrastructure Development. And in each of these, marks have been made, and such that will leave behind effects beyond the short to the long and even longer terms.For instance, his little efforts at job creation has seen over 112 constituents into permanent employment offers within the private sector, civil service and service organisations. This is not just above a hundred persons deducted from the mass of unemployed hands, but also the making of bread winners for more than a hundred families, and discouraging same number from resorting to crime by helping them find belief in the dignity of labour. In addition, his scorecard has a record of at least 20 constituents as beneficiaries of business startups between one and two million naira. In an economy where accessing capital in tens and hundreds of thousands to fund business ideas has been one herculean task, one regime of representation has been able to provide as much as a million naira each for up to 20 citizens. This means that a beneficiary with business interest in fashion designing whose basic startup needs were a sewing machine and workstation, would be able to afford auxiliary equipments and still have some more funds left for such secondary needs as paid advertising to announce their brands into the market. And all of these, plus the N500k (each) grant for over 70 constituents are aside other lesser packages and programmes that either provided direct funds to constituents or exposed them to indirect fundings from other sources, all for the aim of boosting economic prosperity and self-dependence within the constituency.Under what he titles ""Welfare Programmes"", Ukpong-udo had, upon assuming office, planned programmes targeted at touching every household in Ikono/Ini. At this point of seeking continuation, the concern should be whether this had gone beyond the cheapness of talking, to making conscious and sincere efforts towards actualisation. If the efforts in human capital development has not been enough to go round, the Macaire Mother and Child Care Programme should have completed the circle. This healthcare initiative targeted at eradicating maternal and infant mortality in the constituency and with random extension to  the rest of the state, has been operational towards providing incentives to encourage pregnantwomen to submit to professional medical care. Consistently running since November 2019, the said initiative has seen well over 200 pregnant women in the cover areas through successful deliveries with no fatalities recorded.Conceding to the attribution of his life and successes to the privilege of having formal education, man had also chosen to use this first shot in public service to advance literacy rate as well as personal skills development within his constituency by investing constituency funds in education and trainings. Here, the records have been equally massive, recording scholarship grants that have already produced graduates among 40 beneficiaries, as well as exigency support funds for another 40 undergraduates. Several training workshops for constituents in areas of specialty such as peace and conflict resolution, agriculture as well as a special one on information technology for science teachers, also add to the list, with an effective touch of infrastructural boost such as freshly built and renovated classroom blocks, laboratories and market stalls, among others across the constituency, to further advance the cause of making the representative aspect of democracy more meaningful.In addition to all of these is a sound record in lawmaking, having pushed a number of bills and other pieces of legislation numbering up to 14 into the 9th Assembly record, including one for the establishment of a Human Resource Development Council. Also in record under his name are, the Administration of Criminal Justice Act (Amendment) bill, Factories Act (Repeal and Enactment) bill, and very significantly, a bill seeking provision for the establishment of Federal Medical Centre in Ikono, Akwa Ibom State, among others. Also, out of concern over the increasing rate of brain drain in the health sector, Rep Ukpong-udo moved a motion praying for efforts on the part of the federal government to arrest the situation. This, alongside another motion that prayed for urgent attention on a case of Landslide in Odoro Ikpe and Ibam Edet communities of the constituency, are just part of the rest. The latter had yielded result almost immediately when the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) promptly responded to arrest the situation.With all of these established facts, one would then wonder what defines competency and true public service character if these do not. And to have folks not just willing, but also agitating for the replacement of a representative who has been able to make his first term and first ever opportunity in public office this much impacting, is reason analysts of rationality and idealism will always view zoning as a distraction to the selection of credible leadership.Like a banker friend usually opines, zoning only creates a backdoor for mediocrity to creep into a business as serious as leadership. Else, what genuine reason would one give for wanting to sacrifice a productive bird at hand for another whose productivity is not guaranteed. Matter of fact, the progenitors, in drawing these zoning arrangements should always find a space to fix the clause that based on scarcity of credible leadership in the country, the need to retain one whenever found, must supersede whatever arrangement was made for zoning.In the Ikono/Ini case, the productivity of Ukpong-udo's leadership is not just a work of the pen or keypad for PR sake, there are living and bountiful evidences to substantiate. The streets of his constituency are full of testimonies to his impacting representation, even those in the supposed favoured zone have in their off-public gatherings, confessed to this— reason, he is the contender to beat in this contest. While the other minority unit of a camp had hurriedly gone into undue celebrations because Ukpong-udo's clearance was delayed for no genuine reason, theirs was nothing compared to the wild ecstatic jubilations that erupted in the constituency when that hurdle was finally surmounted. That was enough to separate reality from the propagandas.Revisiting the biblical reference in the first paragraph, it is almost clear that despite attempts to paint a massively productive representation with gloomy colours, Ikono/Ini people are persistently holding on to the bright side. Like the biblical accusers, they have spent so much energy and resources in trying to make constitutents and electorates at all levels see Ukpong-udo's second term bid as ""law-breaking"", yet, the constituents, banking on the records on ground, have remained resolute in setting their eyes on the benefits ahead. For, try as hard as the accusers may to refuse admitting this truth, it remains that this representation has, for those it could not this time, touched their relatives or kinsmen, and it will only be a matter of time to spread this touch closer and directly to them, should he be given a mandate extension to continue with this vigour.Ubong Sampson (08021419939) writes from his maternal home in Ibam Edet (l), Ini LGA.",Ikono/ini 2023: Sticking To The Law-breaker

960,"CLIMATE CHANGE: WHY AFRICA SHOULD DEFINE ITS ENERGY TRANSITION VISION – OSINBAJO*“No country in the world has been able to industrialize using renewable energy,” Africa should not be treated differently, VP addsThe fact that Climate Change poses challenges of survival and economic development makes it imperative for Africa to define its plan and come up with a vision that addresses its own peculiarities, according to Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, SAN.Prof. Osinbajo stated this Thursday at the Infrastructure Solutions Summit organised by the Africa Finance Corporation (AFC). Speaking on Africa’s position on the transition from gas to renewable energy, the Vice President said, “we are in a peculiar position; this is why Africa needs to come in very forcefully to chart a different path. We are not just challenged in terms of global warming, but for us, it is also the existential challenge of just survival.”It is the point the Vice President has been advocating for more that a year both at home and international forums. This issue was one of the high points of the Summit which featured a set of two Fireside Chats with the VP and the President of Ghana Nana Addo Akufo-Addo, anchored by BBC's Nancy Kacungira.According to Prof. Osinbajo, “there are several voices around the world and in Africa who are saying the same thing. I think that there is some change. The EU has categorized nuclear and gas as green investments, and they are saying they are going to need more investments in gas over the next 10 years so as to be able to meet their targets of 2050. “They are leaving us room to say that we, in Africa, are going to be needing investments in gas in the next 30 years for us to be able to meet our targets.”Continuing, the VP noted that “Africa first needs to come together to put out a vision that is ours for climate change or carbon neutrality by 2050, 2070 or whenever it is convenient.“I don't think that Africa has articulated the vision yet, but there are ongoing efforts towards that. We think that at Egypt COP27 (forthcoming climate change conference in Egypt), we will begin to articulate an African vision and initiative, because all of the decisions were initiated and taken by wealthier countries where they defined practically everything about how we respond to climate change. But our own peculiarities and challenges are different.“We need to have access to energy, access to electricity just to be able to survive and create industry for the millions of people. So, Africa has an existential challenge and survival around our economies,” he added.Justifying the case for a wholly African plan and vision on Climate Change, the Vice President said, “no country in the world has been able to industrialize using renewable energy and we (Africa) have been asked to industrialize using renewable energy when everybody else in the world knows that we need gas-powered industries for business.“We need to have investments in fossil fuels. we need energy access for development. I am sure the force of the logic will make it inevitable for African leaders to see that it is actually the way to go.“We actually need to create room for investments, not just in natural gas for export, but for cooking and for industry. So, I think that the sheer force of the logic of using gas to benefit our communities will make it inevitable for us to invest in fossil fuels.” Responding to a question on infrastructure development, the Vice President said the Buhari administration is committed to the infrastructure development of the country.According to Prof. Osinbajo, “we have a Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund in the order of a billion dollars for a start. We started with the seed fund of about a trillion naira.”He said “I think we have key opportunities, and it may be impossible now; we might need to do more. For me, I think what we need to do will be more innovation. “There's a huge gap there, but I think innovation is what will play a significant part. For example, seeing the models that already exist, there is plenty of room for more improvements; (such as) insurance that has not yet been leveraged or used.”Aside from President Akufo-Addo of Ghana, other speakers at the opening session of the summit were the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Kingsley Obiora; President of AFC, Mr Samaila Zubairu; President of the AFREXIM Bank Prof. Benedict Orama among others.Laolu AkandeSenior Special Assistant to the President on Media & PublicityOffice of the Vice President12th May, 2022",Climate Change: Why Africa Should Define Its Energy Transition Vision – Osinbajo

He wants to be the Bride in every wedding and the corpse in every funeral. The centre of the political universe. He took the credit for making President Buhari,  president. Tinubu will run President Buhari and other leaders of APC out of the Party as president and leader, of the party. He cannot share the limelight with anyone. He is not used to sharing the ecosystem, it must be about him.Tinubu returned from self-exile and joined Alliance for Democracy, AD. He was not a founding member, but he tried to hijack the Party. When he didn't succeed, he divided the party using Senator Akinfenwa. He then started Action Congress, AC, where he was the ultimate king. AC became ACN. ACN merged with CPC, APP, and others to form APC.In Lagos, he is the State.  No one can be anything without his imprimatur. Governors are his errand boys and can only disagree with him at their peril. He keeps them guessing about getting second term so he can control them fully. Only Fashola showed some independent streak. The rest are like robot. The current one is acting like a victim of a brain snatch operation.  Lagos is used as evidence of his leadership, but Lagos is the chief reason why he should never be  president and the leader of the country and party. He will become a permanent sole administrator in Nigeria as he is in Lagos. Lagos is the smallest State in the country. Without traffic congestion, and with good roads, there is no place that will take over one hour to reach. Lagos is currently making over N45B monthly as IGR. If   allocation from the Federation Account is added, we will be talking of over N46B. But the issue is Lagos has nothing to show for this huge resources. It has no good roads in major parts, it cannot stand 10 minutes rain without being flooded because of poor drainage or lack of it, it is dirty, less than 40% of residents have pipe-borne water, it has no airports or seaports of her own. Poorer States have these things. The airports and seaports in Lagos were built by the FG. Lagos has built only 2 or 3 bridges- Aja and Ogba. Almost all the bridges in Lagos were built by the FG. The State is largely a slum. Like Femi Falana said, only few people are feeling the impact of the wealth of Lagos.As Governor, he had 3 deputies. Kofo Bucknor, Femi Pedro, and the former chairman of the party who was his last deputy for 3 months. Fashola had 2 deputies- Sarah Sosan and Joke Adefulure. Tinubu made the change because of his desire for  maximum loyalty. Sarah we were told, supported Fashola against Tinubu when he sought to deny him  second term as he did to Ambode, and she was replaced. Why are his commencement associates leaving him in droves? Control. No one can overtake him or aspire to be like him. He is an Emperor and his words are laws. Anyone who does not bow to him is a traitor, and it does not matter that he is a serial traitor. Maya Angelo said if someone showed you who he is, believe him the first time, don't be deceived. Tinubu is who he is. He cannot change. He is already taking shots at the party and the President. Ask Pa Adesanya, Pa Ayo Adebanjo, Pa Reuben Fasoronti, Pa Ajasin, and many others, those alive will tell you about him.Everything he does is about Tinubu. In 2011, he supported Buhari/Bakare ticket on the conditions that Bakare will sign an undated resignation letter, so he can become Vp after the election. Bakare refused and Tinubu sold out. He wants to be president because he wants to fulfil his personal life-long ambition- it is not about Nigeria- it is about Tinubu.  Don't let Tinubu happen to Nigeria. Please!Copied",Don't Let Tinubu Happen To Nigeria. Please!

968,"WE WILL FOCUS MORE ON IMPROVING SECURITY, ECONOMY, LIVES OF COMMON MAN, SAYS OSINBAJO IN BAUCHI*If not (that I am an Emir), maybe I’d have asked His Excellency to make me his campaign coordinator for Bauchi – Emir to VP*Tijaniyya Leader, Sheik Dahiru Usman assures VP ""I’ll double up my prayers for you, now as Presidential aspirant""*VP also meets with FCT delegatesIncreasing opportunities for young people, providing lasting solutions to the country’s security challenges, improving the economy, and the lives of the common man are some of the reasons why Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, is in the 2023 presidential race.The VP gave this indication yesterday in Bauchi State, in continuation of his engagements with stakeholders and delegates of the All Progressives Congress (APC) across states.Citing global challenges, including the previous slump in crude oil prices that had led to a recession, the COVID-19 pandemic, and Russia-Ukraine war, the Prof. Osinbajo stated that “the economy is one that we have to pay constant attention to… And, of course, security, is also very important. These are issues that concerns us, which we are trying to deal with every day.”Speaking on security during his interaction with the delegates, the VP said the focus of the Buhari administration is to enhance local capacity on arms and ammunition production, adding that Nigeria must build on current challenges to develop a robust system that is able to tackle all of the challenges on scale.On sustaining positive growth in the economy, the VP said interventions that promote youth employment will be prioritized, especially the provision of necessary infrastructure. In agriculture, he noted that if basic infrastructure is provided, farmers will record improvements in yield and improved living conditions for their families. He added that the Buhari administration has prioritised ramping up local fertiliser production to support the massive farming activities going on across the country. Regarding the power sector, he said changing the grid structure, decentralizing the distribution network and reviewing existing regulations are some of the decisions that are being considered to overhaul the power sector for better result. Similarly, in the education sector, the Vice President noted that leveraging technological innovation to improve teaching methods and curriculum will greatly impact the quality of education in the country.Later, while speaking to the media at the end of his interaction with delegates, the Vice President said his meeting with the APC delegates have been fruitful.“It is not enough to say, ‘support me’; I also want to get a sense of what they want and what they would like to see from a government and an incoming government. ""The interaction is usually quite an intensive one, where we have a back-and-forth, and questions are asked; I think it has been very fulfilling and satisfying,” he stated.Earlier, the Vice President, on arrival at the Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa International Airport, Bauchi, proceeded to the Emir’s Palace to pay a courtesy call on the Emir of Bauchi, HRH Dr. Rilwan Suleiman Adamu.Speaking at the Emir’s Palace, the Vice President buttressed the need to further unite the country, considering Nigeria’s diversity in religion and ethnicities. According to him, “we must treat everybody with fairness and justice.“I believe that this is one of the reasons why it is vital, even in putting ourselves forward for the position of President of Nigeria, to bear in mind that the unity of this country is one of the important things,” he added.Thanking the Emir for his hospitality, the VP recalled his 2019 visit to the State to flag off the Rural Electrification Project for Ningi/Warji Local Government Area of the state, and also commission the Shared Facility for soap and groundnut oil making clusters during the MSMEs Clinic in the State.The VP said, “our concerns as a government have always been how to ensure that the common man is given a fair chance to be employed, to have a decent living, which is why several of the projects that we are undertaking have been to better the lots of the common man. “But also, we have been concerned about young people, how we can improve, not just the quality of education of our young people, but the opportunities for young people to get jobs, to be employed and have a decent standard of living.”While praying for fruitful and successful deliberations for VP’s engagements, the Emir of Bauchi said, “we believe that power belongs to God and He gives power to who he wishes to give. “Your Excellency, we are not politicians and cannot participate in politics, but still, we advise wisely and prayerfully for whatever would be the success. If not (that I am an Emir), maybe I would have asked His Excellency to make me his campaign coordinator for Bauchi,” the Emir stated with a smile, while praying for fruitful deliberations for the VP.Similarly, a foremost Islamic scholar and cleric in the state, Tijaniyya leader, Sheik Dahiru Usman Bauchi, expressed his support for the Vice President yesterday, while the VP was in the State.“We are going to support you. I have been praying for you, and now that you are seeking this position, I will double it, and by the grace of God, it is also my wish that the next time you come here, it will be as President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,” the cleric stated.During his visit, the Vice President also paid his respects at the tomb of late Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, Nigeria’s first Prime Minister. There, he described the late Prime Minister as a role model “who always talks about the unity of this country, the unity of the faith, the unity of the different ethnic groups.”“I pray that his legacy, the legacy of peace, the legacy of unity, tolerance, humility and integrity, will continue and that people who aspire to the leadership of our country, those who aspire to lead, and also the young people, will learn from it,” he said.Senator Adamu Bulkachuwa from the State; former governor of Bauchi State, Mohammed Abdullahi Abubakar; and other dignitaries accompanied the Vice President on the visit.On return from Bauchi, the Vice President also met with APC delegates in the FCT, Abuja, last night, taking questions from them on several national and political issues.Laolu AkandeSenior Special Assistant to the President on Media & PublicityOffice of the Vice President11th May, 2022","We Will Focus More On Improving Security, Economy, Lives Of Common Man, Says Vp"

After the meeting, he attended to journalists where he answered some questions. In his response to the question of a consensus arrangement by the party, Tinubu said he preferred a process of democracy to choose who becomes the APC flag bearer. In his words: “I want democracy; I am voting for democracy, one man, one vote.” [/b]It is very laughable that such a statement is coming from Tinubu himself who is use to candidate imposition in Lagos state. In fact, democracy and Tinubu are like parallel lines as far as Lagos politics is concerned. This is a man who determines who gets what and when in Lagos.

If APC should follow a consensus pattern in the forthcoming Primary Election, nothing will happen, Tinubu will lost out because clearly, he's not the ""anointed one.""[b][/b]When he was Lagos state governor, he changed his deputies like clothes. He made futile attempts to stop the second term bid of Babatunde Raji Fashola due to a fracas they had. However, the overwhelming and visible achievements of Fashola made it impossible for him to do so.[b][/b]Unfortunately, he succeeded in Ambode's case. He denied his second term bid because he (Ambode) refused to grant the 'godfather's numerous demands.'[b] [/b]If not for his Presidential ambition, his son would have been the next governor of the state. He succeeded in giving Iyaloja of Lagos to his daughter, Chief Mrs Folashade Tinubu Ojo.

976,"Following the reports, Jonathan rejected the presidential form of the ruling APC purchased for him on Monday, purportedly by a group of supporters from the northern region.There have been reports that a coalition of northern socio-cultural groups, basically of Fulani extraction, purchased N100 million nomination and expression of interest forms of the ruling party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), for former President Goodluck Jonathan to contest for President again in 2023.Following the reports, Jonathan rejected the presidential form of the ruling APC purchased for him on Monday, purportedly by a group of supporters from the northern region.Speaking through his Media Adviser, Ikechukwu Eze, the former president said it was an insult for the group to have bought him the forms without his permission.However, sources told SaharaReporters on Tuesday that claims by the former President that he did not authorise the purchase of the multi-million-naira forms are far from the truth.“Contrary to his denials, former President Goodluck Jonathan gave over N200 million to the governor of Jigawa, Mohammed Badaru, to purchase the APC nomination and expression of interest forms for him,” a source privy to the arrangement told SaharaReporters.Interestingly, the Jigawa governor, Badaru last week joined other interested presidential aspirants to vie for the ticket of the APC by buying the N100 million nomination and expression of interest forms.“I will join the Presidential race since everyone knows I’m a highly qualified person to do the job,” Badaru was quoted as saying during an APC stakeholders’ meeting held at Government House in Dutse last Tuesday.The governor was also said to have told the gathering during the meeting that he was pressurised by his colleagues to contest for the presidential seat.His media aide, Auwalu Sankara, said his principal had sought President Muhammadu Buhari’s blessings before buying the forms.But SaharaReporters learnt that the Jigawa governor had bought the forms and come up with the statements as a ruse to deceive Nigerians; as he was indeed working for Jonathan.It was further learnt that Jonathan backed out of the plan and swiftly came up with the denial after the APC National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, had refused to guarantee that the former President would be the consensus candidate of the ruling party.Jonathan was Nigeria’s leader as a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which is now an opposition party.“The reason why he (Jonathan) gave him that much money – over N200 million – was that he asked the governor to buy himself a form too in order to cover up the deal,” the source said.“And upon purchasing the form, Jonathan alerted Buhari. Buhari told him to meet with the APC National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, but Adamu said he can’t guarantee him as a consensus candidate“At that point, GEJ (Goodluck Ebele Jonathan) started denying that he purchased the form,” another source said.SaharaReporters broke the story of how a cabal in the ruling APC had pushed for Jonathan to succeed Buhari, after being impressed by how the former President never openly criticised Buhari government despite its ineptitude and the insults the APC, as an opposition party, hurled at him (Jonathan) ahead of the 2015 presidential election.The fact that Jonathan cannot spend more than one term in office, if they can manage to get him there, is also not lost on the cabal. However, SaharaReporters has also reported how Jonathan was later called a betrayer by the cabal after he failed to fulfil some of the conditions given to him, including convincing some PDP governors to defect to the APC.http://saharareporters.com/2022/05/10/exclusive-how-jonathan-gave-jigawa-governor-badaru-over-n200million-sent-him-buy-apc","How Jonathan Gave Jigawa Governor, Badaru Over N200million, Sent Him To Buy APC"

I'm not desperate, I  only want to complete my agenda for liberating my people,"" he said.Dr. Ottah Agbo, who is the chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Narcotic Drugs, said it is unfortunate some think being in the House of Representatives is about getting access to travelling abroad and a means of attaining personal comfort because the constituency is in dire need of development.""I am there and even though I have covered much ground,  there's still much to be done.""My desire is to consolidate the fulfilment of my agenda which is to serve the people and  bring more development to my constituency,"" he added.The Lawmaker said he is doing all that for posterity and to leave a good name in future.He thanked the Ogbadibo Councillors for their support and the visit which accorded him the opportunity to interact with them, describing his relationship with the people of Ogbadibo as akin to the love between Romeo and Juliet, adding that he does not take for granted the massive support he enjoys from both the low and high in the LG.The parliamentarian said he does not regret stepping down for an Ogbadibo in 2015 when he gunned for the House of Representatives seat and promised to secure more jobs for the youths in his constituency, continue the empowerment programs as well as ongoing projects.""They accuse me of doing so much and I plead guilty to that but I intend to do more because that accusation is one that I cannot deny or shy away from till my people are completely liberated,"" he stated.Members of the Ogbadibo Legislative Council pledged their support to see to the return of Dr. Ottah Agbo to the Green Chamber vowing that all their votes would be for him.The councilors led by the leader of the legislature, Hon.

So, we must do the needful to ensure that in 2023, our party must have a candidate that has the capacity, competence, commitment to build a better Nigeria,” he said.The two-term former Anambra state governor lamented the rising debt profile of the country since the Buhari regime came on board.According to him, all countries of the world borrow but others use the borrowed funds to develop and improve their countries and people, Nigeria borrows to share and all that we require to take our country out of poverty is to invest a lot, invest in our GDP.He informed the delegates that he had the capacity to tackle the security challenges bedeviling the country just as he admonished them to think about the future of their children while voting during the convention.“Our country today is insecure and people ask me, ‘how are you going to tackle this issue of insecurity?’ You can fight insecurity in two ways: firstly, you can fight insecurity the natural way and that is making the youths have a means of livelihood. If you don’t know where the next meal will come from, there are tendencies that you go into criminality. So, you must pull people out of poverty because the more you pull people out of poverty, the more you reduce criminality.“The second way to tackle insecurity is solving it through men – ensure that you fund security agencies and have capable men, train, empower and provide them with all the necessary equipment they need and this can be done.“When you go to vote at the convention, please, look at the future of your children and ask yourself, ‘which kind of society do I want these children to live in?’ Even if they give you money or buy you lunch, collect it but when you go to vote, look at the future of your children.

Muslims have Sharia, the Christians I don’t know what their doctrines say,” he said.“If I had done anything wrong, I would have been tried in court. NAPTIP wanted to try the case and they dropped the matter because I didn’t do anything wrong.“Whatever you are doing, if you are ignorant of the law, then you are bound to have problems. Once you do anything according to law, you don’t have a problem in any society.”When asked if he would consider marrying a minor again, he neither replied in an affirmative nor negative tone.Rather, he said that under Sharia law, there are some criteria that will be followed before any marriage would take place.He insisted that his decisions would always be backed by the law as he would never be caught doing anything unlawful.The APC chieftain promised to turn around the fortunes of Nigeria should he clinch the APC’s ticket ahead of the 2023 general elections.https://www.channelstv.com/2022/05/10/no-nigerian-law-determines-how-you-get-married-yerima-speaks-on-child-marriage/LalasticlalaMynd44",Child Marriage: No Nigerian Law Determines When And How You Get Married – Yerima

NEC commended the dedication of the National Working Committee (NWC) under the Chairmanship of Sen. Dr. Iyorchia Ayu in effectively piloting the affairs of our Party, particularly in the organization of processes preparatory to the 2023 general elections.2. NEC restated its confidence in the ability of the NWC to lead our Party to victory in the 2023 general elections.3. NEC applauded other organs of the Party; namely the Board of Trustees (BoT), the PDP Governors’ Forum, the National Assembly Caucus, the Zonal and State Organs of the Party, our structure at various levels, critical stakeholders and teeming members across the country for their efforts in strengthening our Party in the mission to Rescue and Rebuild our nation from the misrule of the APC.4.  NEC commended the NWC for the deft handling of issues relating to the conduct and outcome of our Party Congresses at various levels preparatory to the election of candidates for various elective positions in the 2023 general elections.5. NEC applauded the spirit of sportsmanship being exhibited by our leaders, critical stakeholders, aspirants and party members on issues relating to our Congresses.On the State of the nation 6. NEC strongly decried the worsening insecurity and continued killing of innocent Nigerians by terrorists who are emboldened by the exposed refusal of the APC-led government to confront the terrorists even when it knows their locations, listens to their phone conversations and even aware of their plans.7. NEC Condemned the failure/refusal of the APC government to rescue our citizens still languishing in their abductors’ dens including a victims of last month’s terrorism attack on the Abuja/Kaduna train. NEC urged the Federal Government to live up to its Constitutional duty to secure life and property and ensure an unconditional release of all the abductees. 8. NEC expressed dismay that our security command and control coordination structure has collapsed under President Muhammadu Buhari as Mr. President remains “absent” having abdicated his duties as Commander-in-Chief and surrendering sovereignty over a substantial part of our country to terrorists. 9.  NEC further condemned the humongous corruption and deliberate economic manipulations in the APC Government which have crippled our productive sector and resulted in the unbearable high cost of food items and other essential goods and services with consequential excruciating economic hardship to our citizens.10. NEC rejected the continuing closure of public universities in Nigeria due to the refusal/failure of the APC government to decisively address the lingering industrial action by lecturers in public universities despite the huge resources at its disposal. It cautioned the APC to stop playing with the emotions, destiny and future of our youths and take action to address the industrial action immediately so that our children can go back to their classes.11. NEC condemned in very strong terms the mass looting of our national treasury and diversion of public funds through orchestrated purchase of APC Presidential Expression of Interest and Nomination Forms by all manner of persons at excessive N100 million to warehouse slush funds for APC to rig the 2023 general elections. We restate our demand to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to investigate all APC Presidential aspirants in this regard.12. NEC restated the call by the Party for the immediate resignation, arrest and prosecution of the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, for alleged manipulations and financial impropriety in the CBN which contributed to the collapse of our national economy.13. NEC vehemently rejected the continued stay of Mr. Emefiele as CBN Governor after being confirmed as a card-carrying member of the APC. The CBN is the custodian and keeper of all INEC sensitive materials used in all elections. Having been confirmed as a member of the APC, Mr. Emefiele, can no longer be trusted with INEC sensitive materials which are key to the guarantee of free, fair and credible elections. 14.

After a very extensive deliberation NEC aligned with the recommendation of the PDP National Zoning Committee that the Presidential Election should now be left open.

997,"US’ DOUBLE STANDARDS IN HER NIGERIAN MISSIONBY Richard BabatundeA Lagos Based International Relations AnalystThe United States’ Missions in parts of Africa are replete with under hand deals. It is unbelievably embarrassing. Aside the fact that the missions have abandoned their core objectives of advancing peace and other consular services, they have become centers of meddlesomeness and interferers in internal governance systems of host countries. These adversarial actions have been deemed despicable. Over the decades, America has engaged in activities aimed at undermining administrations across the Continent. The US Department of State is either doling out bad predictions and estimates about African countries or issuing recurrent but repulsive movement and travel alerts for their nationals suggesting the region is constantly unsafe. While the advisories are oftentimes exaggerated, the scare actions are done solely to justify and acquire more funding from their home government for self-serving interest of the diplomats.Notably, the US Mission in Nigeria has continued to exploit insecurity to justify its ostentatious proposals to her country. While the US and its agents exploit security concerns and socio-economic challenges bedeviling the country, it has failed to curb its home-based security challenges that are threatening the safety of its citizens. It is common knowledge that gun violence, mass shootings, rising drug-related crimes, arson, homicide, rape, suicide, aggravated assault, robbery and cybercrime are more prevalent in the United States than in Nigeria. White supremacist activities are even more active. Surprisingly, American government has not only turned a blind eye to these security concerns over the years, but has also continued to downplay or censor the gravity of crimes in their homeland. It is estimated that mass shootings is responsible for the death of over 39,000 people each year, implying that over 360 people get shot every day in the country. While the United States ranks higher than the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia in terms of mass shootings, another study found that nearly one-third of the world's public mass shootings (90 of 292 between 1966 and 2012) occurred in the United States.To the US and its missions in Nigeria, the daily gun violence and attacks in their country are excusable. However, it beats ones imagination, that the pockets of restiveness in Nigeria are more important to them than their frequent incidences of violence. If these attacks by armed citizens in US were to happen in Nigeria, the American government and its agents would have long premised on the situation to undermine its leadership. While the US has persistently highlighted issues surrounding Nigeria’s socio-cultural complications, it has apparently ignored its many related socio-cultural challenges and unanswered relevant questions on gun control and racism. White supremacy crises have continued to manifest through consistent violent attacks, racial discrimination, unfair immigration policies, and the skewed media role against the black race. More worrisome is the growing number of atrocities been committed in the US by white supremacist groups, with black men as principal victims. Over the decades, white supremacist ideology was used to rationalize the genocide of Native Americans and the enslavement of blacks and their descendants from the Colonial period to the 19th century. This practice has remained within American government institutions. Furthermore, it is quite amazing how the US covertly supported dissidents that staged the ENDSARS protests across Nigeria. The subversive elements were allowed to use twitter and other similar platforms to organize, communicate and execute attacks against citizens, critical infrastructure and institutions in the country. Jack, the ex CEO of Twitter, in consolidating the interest of American government to threaten public order and stability in Nigeria, out-rightly refused to suspend accounts of the ENDSARS organizers. Meanwhile, the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau after he was hit by truckers protests in the country, described their action as “unacceptable”. Twitter, still under the control of Jack, wasted no time in suspending the twitter accounts of the protesting truckers, what double standards! The 2021 attack and insurrection at Capitol Hill has indeed exposed the Achilles’ heel of the American government and its systems.There is definitely no gainsaying the fact that America is as corrupt as the Nigerian governments they castigate and term corrupt. It is on record that the United States' resistance to corruption has declined in recent years. It has dropped from its rank of 18th in 2016, to 27th out of 180 countries on the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index of 2021. More so, in the recently released annual Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), the United States fell to a low of 67 out of a maximum possible score of 100, down from a high of 76 in 2015. This simply means the lower the score, the worse the corruption. The many ways of how corruption thrives in the US include the influence of wealthy individuals over government; “pay to play” politics and the revolving doors between elected government office, for-profit companies, and professional associations; and the abuse of the US financial system by corrupt foreign kleptocrats and local elites. It is, however, laudable that Nigerian government and the populace are beginning to wake up from their slumber and opposing the offensive attitude of US Government and their counterparts. In most cases, they are more corrupt and churning out projections and security alerts to their nationals, only to secure more allocations to fund their extravagant lifestyles. These so called US diplomats love to live large. They use the constant security scare to deceive their home government to get more money for ostensive living in the host country, acquire treated (armoured) cars; build palatial residences in the US and frolic with women of sorts.  Nigeria and other African governments must sustain this ""wokeness"" and resist the continuous attempt to undermine their sovereignty at the expense of crooked personalities and self-centered interests.",Abeg Make Dem No Use Their Yardstick Take Measure Us Oh.
998,"By Sunny Green ItodoOne of democracy's blessings and curse is rivalry. Ordinarily, (healthy) rivalry is supposed to bring out the beauty of democracy as it exposes the ""strengths"" and ""weaknesses"" of aspirants to the electorate in order to help them vote the best candidate. Sadly, in Africa where animal kingdom-styled politickings and ""demo-crazy'' is the order of day, it is more or less a curse.But there is this African politician, a Nigerian at that, whose brand of politics is totally worthy of commendation and emulation. He’s Chief Phillip Agbese who seeks to represent Ado/Okpokwu/Ogbadibo Federal Constituency of Benue State. He is redefining politicking.  Agbese prides himself as the talking drum of Agila - Okanga.The UK-trained lawyer and human rights activist has achieved the popularity (and even more) that some politicians often resort to shenanigans and gimmicks to get, even without throwing himself to the mud.He didn't recreate scenes from Nollywood by staging melodramas to spark reactions or controversies. He didn't take a line from Nigerian politicians' traditional playbook by chiding his opponents for every lows of his life. He didn't encourage pen thuggery and hoodlumism. He didn't play the pity card by resorting to emotional blackmailing or raising false alarms to evoke hate against opponents. And yet, he is unarguably the most popular candidate in the race.Okanga, as he is fondly called, I observed, warmed his way into the hearts of the people with his philanthropy, charisma and his philosophy of issues based politics. Recently, I stumbled across a digital poster from the Philip Agbese Campaign Organization (PACO) with the inscription: PROMOTE YOUR ASPIRANT, Don't Insult Others. Primary and General Election will come and go but You and I will remain.I was bedazzled by the civility and humaneness shown in that terse but powerful campaign message. I'm hardly surprised. Chief Phillip Agbese has always been a cosmopolitan and an egalitarian. Even at his campaigns, he always spoke with a sense of civility; the credence of his voice, so soft and charming as opposed to the vulgarism most Nigerian politicians are known for. Being a true democrat, Agbese has repeatedly challenged his opponents to a political debate but none has been able to respond. Aside from the fact that he has the highest academic credentials among the aspirants, Agbese believes rivalry should be an intellectual exercise, and not vulgar political exhibitionism, shenanigans, tantrums and their ilks.One of his biggest campaigners has been his track records. His philanthropic enterprise and humanitarian works are what endeared him to his constituents, so much that his supporters are across party lines.When a person sets a good precedent before aspiring for a political office, the urge of resorting to self-ridicule, gimmicks and lies (unrealistic campaign promises) to gain popularity will be easily defeated.Nigerian politicians can learn a thing from that.Let me conclude by saying, the All Progressives Congress (APC), and indeed Enone have their best shot in Phillip Agbese.

999," Garba Shehu, the Senior Special Assistant to President Muhamma Buhari on Media and Publicity, has said that the President will not investigate how aspirants got the whopping sums of money they spent on buying the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) presidential nomination forms.He disclosed this while featuring on a Channels TV programme on Thursday.No fewer than 30 aspirants have picked the ruling party’s presidential nomination and expression of interest forms, but Shehu said it was the job of the anti-graft agencies, the media and Civil Society Organisatio (CSOs) to find out the source of such funds and not the President.He said, “The question is how did they get N100m to buy the forms? I think the question should go to each individual aspirant. The kind of scrutiny is up to the civil societies and the media to ask questions, but saying the President should launch an investigation. I don’t think that is the direct way to go.“If ICPC or EFCC will say ‘Mr Permanent Secretary, where did you get this money from?’, the President will not stop them.”‘N100m forms should be applauded’According to Shehu, the cost of the Presidential forms of the APC should be applauded as the party needs the money to run its electioneering activities.“The party made a case for this and the national chairman was applauded because this is a party that doesn’t take money from the treasury,” he stated.Meanwhile, Shehu said the President’s directive that Ministers, heads of agencies and other appointees seeking elective offices should resign their appointment was not in connection with section 84 of the Electoral Act.“He made no reference to section 84, he simply gave the directive and I think it’s clear that as the head of the executive arm of government he owns the executive authority and power to decide,” Shehu said.He allayed concerns that there would be a vacuum in government following the directive of the President. “The President has given his directives, clearly stated out and it’s for everyone to place themselves where they belong.“The directive from the government is that if you are a minister and you have a minister of state, hand over to the minister of state. If you don’t have a minister of state, hand over to the permanent secretary.“If you are a head of a government agency, parastatal, extra ministerial government department ambassador hand over to the most senior officer in your departmenthttps://dailytrust.com/why-buhari-will-not-investigate-those-obtaining-n100m-forms-presidency",Buhari Will Applaud The 100million Naira Paid By Presidential Aspirants: FG
